## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Highly potent active pharmaceutical ingredients (HPAPIs) represent a significant change in the way pharmaceutical innovators are using small molecules to deliver new patient therapies. The shift toward highly potent APIs has not only led to a pipeline of more effective medicines that require lower doses and lead to fewer side effects, but also to new manufacturing challenges. During the last decade, the demand for HPAPIs has grown rapidly, mainly as a result of advances in clinical pharmacology and oncology research. HPAPIs drug manufacturing, storage and packaging is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) regulations enforced by the U.S. FDA, EMEA and other international regulatory agencies. Contract manufacturing of HPAPI has been preferred over captive production due to high degree of competition and reduced profitability, geographical advantage and cost-effectiveness.
