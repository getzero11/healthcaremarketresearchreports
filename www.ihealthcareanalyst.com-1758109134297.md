## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Livestock health can be improved through the advent of sensitive and specific diagnostic technologies and new generation vaccines through the availability of genomic sequence data. Infectious diseases reduce animal welfare and the quality and yield of animal products, with significant direct costs, impacting public health and reducing land-use efficiency. Endemic diseases, such as bovine viral diarrhoea and Johne’s disease are increasingly entering the public consciousness and becoming the target of national eradication strategies.

Reliable and cost-effective diagnostic tools are required to allow vets and farmers to make the informed animal husbandry decisions that lessen the disease burden. Advanced biotechnology-based diagnostic tests make it possible to identify the disease causing agent(s) at a species/ sub-species/ type level and to monitor the impact of such diseases. Novel molecular diagnostics are being developed for companion and livestock animals to be adaptable to different diseases in the shortest time possible, so that emerging diseases can be detected and eliminated quickly. They are also designed to be specific, sensitive, easy to use, cost-effective, and fast, allowing infected cattle to be identified on the same day as performing the test.
