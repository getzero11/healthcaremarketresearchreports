## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Epilepsy treatment devices, particularly neurostimulation and neuromodulation devices, offer promising solutions for managing seizures in patients who do not respond well to medications. Implantable neurostimulators, such as vagus nerve stimulators (VNS), deliver electrical impulses to the vagus nerve, helping to prevent seizures before they start.

Deep brain stimulators (DBS) are surgically implanted devices that send electrical signals to specific areas of the brain to control abnormal activity. Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) systems, on the other hand, monitor brain activity in real-time and deliver targeted electrical stimulation to prevent seizures when abnormal patterns are detected.
