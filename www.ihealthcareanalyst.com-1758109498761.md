Blood cancers, or hematologic cancers, affect the production and function of blood cells. Most of these cancers start in the bone marrow where blood is produced. According to American Cancer Society (2015), each year, more than 162,000 Americans are diagnosed with a blood cancer accounting for more than 9% of all new cancer diagnoses. Major types of blood cancers include leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Treatment for blood cancer depends on the type of cancer, age, cancer progression rate, extent of cancer spread and other factors. A range of approved targeted therapies for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) includes monoclonal antibodies and B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors, that treat the root cause of the disease with fewer risks to the immune system and often result in remission. In addition, combinations of these targeted therapies are being explored providing potential new treatment options for CLL patients with fewer side effects. There are additional targeted therapies for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) that are able to effectively treat many of the identified mutated forms of CML by disrupting signals that lead to cancer cell growth. Many of the medicines in the pipeline are building on novel scientific approaches and looking at new ways to treat blood cancers. Almost 40 percent of the new anticancer drugs developed since 2000 were first approved for blood cancer patients, and are now helping patients with other cancers and chronic diseases.
