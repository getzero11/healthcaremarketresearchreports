## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Respiratory disease tests are required for the diagnosis of any chronic or acute respiratory disorders. The main clinical respiratory function tests include diagnosis, assessment of severity, monitoring treatment and evaluation of prognosis. Many physicians opt for blood gases to evaluate oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, lung or pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to help diagnose and monitor lung function, and chest X-rays and or CT (computed tomography) scans to look at lung structure. Majority of respiratory tests are designed either to identify obstructions in the respiratory tract, or to observe the efficiency of the lungs in exchanging respiratory gases. Equipment used to detect pulmonary abnormalities hold immense potential due to increasing prevalence of various respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia.
