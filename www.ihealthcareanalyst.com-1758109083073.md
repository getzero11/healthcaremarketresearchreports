Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a worldwide health burden with high fatality and permanent disability rates. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for only around 5% of all strokes but is a major cause of death and disability. Eighty-five per cent of SAH occurs because of rupture of an intra-cranial aneurysm. The estimated worldwide incidence of SAH is 9/100,000 persons per year with regional variation, and 60% of all acute subarachnoid hemorrhages arise in persons aged 40 to 60. The incidence of new cases of SAH in the United States is about 30,000/year or 10/100,000 persons/year. The important risk factors for the development of cerebral aneurysms are hypertension, smoking, chronic alcohol use, family history of intracranial aneurysms in first-degree relatives and female sex.

The overall prognosis depends on the volume of the initial bleed, re-bleeding, and degree of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Cardiac manifestations and neurogenic pulmonary edema indicate the severity of SAH. Acute management focuses on maintenance of adequate ventilation, hemodynamic stabilization, minimizing the risks of re-bleeding, and achieving a rapid diagnosis.

Subsequent treatment aimed at securing the bleeding source and preventing delayed neurological deficits and non-neurological complications. Nimodipine and other calcium channel antagonists substantially decreases the risk of cerebral infarction and poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH. Triple H therapy is the use of hypertension, hypervolaemia, and haemodilution to improve cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen delivery in the treatment of DCI and vasospasm. Magnesium is neuroprotective and having vasodilatatory properties, both of which could be of benefit in SAH. Statins are HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase) reductase inhibitors used in the management of hypercholesterolaemia. Aggressive endovascular treatment may improve neurological outcome without the risks associated with other treatments such as triple H therapy.
