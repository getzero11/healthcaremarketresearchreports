Heparin is an anticoagulant (blood thinner) that prevents the formation of blood clots. Heparin is used to treat and prevent blood clots in the veins, arteries, or lung. It is also used before surgery to reduce the risk of blood clots. It is used to treat and prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (collectively known as venous thromboembolism) and is also used as part of the treatment of myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Heparin is used on the inside surfaces of various devices such as test tubes and kidney dialysis machines.

Heparin is the foremost clinical anticoagulant with more than 500 million doses consumed globally each year. Heparin and related molecules exhibit a large number of newly discovered biological activities with optimum therapeutic potential.

Advantages of heparin such as immediate onset of action, short half-life, simple laboratory monitoring, ability to be reversed (protamine), and low cost have led to its use worldwide. The major clinical applications of heparin include prevention of blood clotting during dialysis, unwanted blood clotting during open-heart surgery, and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
