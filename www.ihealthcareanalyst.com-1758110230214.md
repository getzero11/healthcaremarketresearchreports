## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by weakened bones, making them more susceptible to fractures. Various drug treatments are available to help strengthen bone density and reduce the risk of fractures.

The most common medications include bisphosphonates, which slow down bone loss and help maintain bone strength. Examples include alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid. Another class of drugs, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like raloxifene (Evista), mimics estrogen’s protective effects on bones, particularly for postmenopausal women. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody, inhibits bone resorption and is given as an injection every six months. Teriparatide and abaloparatide are forms of parathyroid hormone that stimulate new bone formation, helping those with severe osteoporosis. Meanwhile, romosozumab, a newer option, works by increasing bone formation and decreasing bone breakdown.
