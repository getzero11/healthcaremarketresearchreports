## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Immune checkpoint Inhibitor drugs block certain proteins made by some types of immune system cells, such as T cells, and some cancer cells. These proteins help keep immune responses in check and can keep T cells from killing cancer cells. Several drug combinations that include checkpoint inhibitors are in clinical development. Cancer survival rates are generally increasing in the United States. These trends have been partially attributed to improvement in therapeutic strategies. The early success of immune checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors and cancer immunotherapies in general has generated a tremendous interest in further developing and exploring these strategies across the oncology disease spectrum.
