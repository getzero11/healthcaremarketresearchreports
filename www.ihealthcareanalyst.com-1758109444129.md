## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Haemophilia or Hemophilia is a mostly inherited genetic disorder that impairs the body’s ability to make blood clots, a process needed to stop bleeding. The three forms of hemophilia are hemophilia A, B, and C. Haemophilia is not curable, but treated to minimize symptoms and prevent future health complications. The treatment of hemophilia may involve prophylaxis, management of bleeding episodes, treatment of factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors, and treatment and rehabilitation of hemophilia synovitis. Hemophilia treated by replacing the protein that is missing in the blood. All products available to treat hemophilia injected directly into the bloodstream.

The broader hemophilia market will grow at an average 5.9% rate over the forecast period to $17 billion in 2023. While less than 1 million people suffer from hemophilia A or B globally, they are among some of the most costly patients to treat because of frequent transfusions, costly medicines and often have a poor health prognosis, particularly in the absence of treatment. There are ~39,000 patients with haemophilia A and ~10,000 patients with haemophilia B across the EU5 countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) plus the United States.

The preferred treatment for hemophilia is factor replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) slowly injected into a vein. Plasma derived factor concentrates made from human blood. Antifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) used with replacement therapy. Key current treatments are plasma-derived or recombinant in nature, and used prophylactically or on demand (when a bleed occurs). Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a hormone used to treat mild hemophilia A, while not used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A. New versions of a variety of clotting factor drugs are in development, including emicizumab (ACE910) that mimics the cofactor function of factor VIII. Many of these will decrease the rate of bleeding events while improving the convenience of therapy for patients and healthcare providers. Additionally, the market will see a number of drugs launched for orphan diseases. Factor VIII products for haemophilia A and B classified as orphan drugs.

Of the top therapeutic classes, hemophilia drugs have the lowest market share, dominated by recombinant proteins from Baxter, Bayer, and Pfizer. However, pipelines are maturing and longer-acting versions of factors VIII and IX from firms including Novo Nordisk and Biogen Idec are approaching the market. The drug market for haemophila is undergoing major changes, owing to advances in gene therapy and protein engineering and to novel strategies that target negative clotting regulators. Shire purchased Baxalta, Inc. in 2015 and SHP654, a factor VIII gene therapy for hemophilia A. Biogen sells two hemophilia drugs, Eloctate and Alprolix as infusions. Gene therapies in development aim to restore the expression of endogenous FVIII or FIX to reduce bleeding negating the need for prophylaxis and reduce the amount of injected replacement factor required. The phase III pipeline drugs include Emicizumab (Hemlibra), BAY-94-9027, BMN 270, and N8 GP; while phase II drugs include Concizumab, Fitusiran, OPK88005, AMT-061, SB-525, SB-FIX, SPK-8011, and SPK-9001.
