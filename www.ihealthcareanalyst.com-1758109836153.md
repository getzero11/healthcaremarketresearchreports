Biopsy procedure either external or incisional involves extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease which is generally examined under a microscope or analyzed chemically.

Appropriate biopsy methods depend upon a variety of factors, including the size, location, appearance and characteristics of the abnormality. Biopsy devices are gaining importance due to the increasing incidence of cancer globally and the growing willingness of patients to spend money on these medical procedures.

Biopsies are usually performed to identify and diagnose cancerous tumor and to design a suitable treatment plan for the patients. Biopsies are performed using image-guidance modalities such as X-ray imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound imaging.

Biopsy devices make use of three main types of needle-based technologies to withdraw samples, namely, vacuum-assisted, core needle and fine needle aspiration. These procedures can be performed using manually guided systems as well as robotic systems.

The global biopsy devices market report provides market size estimates ($million 2023 to 2033) for key market segmented by product \[needle-based guns (vacuum-assisted biopsy devices, core needle biopsy devices, fine needle aspiration biopsy devices), biopsy needles (disposable needles, reusable needles); biopsy forceps (cold biopsy forceps, hot biopsy forceps), guidance systems (manual systems, robotic systems), others (biopsy brushes, biopsy curettes, biopsy punches)\], and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).
