## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) is a painless method of delivering drugs systemically by applying a drug formulation onto intact and healthy skin. Transdermal delivery represents an attractive alternative to oral delivery of drugs and is poised to provide an alternative to hypodermic injections. The field of transdermal drug delivery, aimed at developing safe and efficacious means of delivering medications across the skin, has in the past and continues to garner much time and investment with the continuous advancement of new and innovative approaches. Transdermal systems should be formulated to provide the maximum thermodynamic driving force for passive diffusion across the skin which is saturated with a sufficient payload of the drug to ensure delivery of drugs across the skin. Technologies used to modify the barrier properties of the stratum corneum can be divided into passive/chemical or active/physical methodologies. Passive methods include the influencing of drug and vehicle interactions and optimization of formulation, in order to modify the stratum corneum structure. Passive methods are relatively easy to incorporate into transdermal patches such as chemical enhancers and emulsions. The active methods for skin permeabilization include ultrasound, electrically assisted methods (electroporation and iontophoresis), velocity based devices (powder injection, jet injectors), thermal approaches (lasers and radio-frequency heating) and mechanical methodologies such as microneedles (MN) and tape stripping.

In delivery systems involving transdermal patches, the drug is stored in a reservoir (reservoir type) or drug dissolved in a liquid or gel-based reservoir (matrix type). Patch-based CVD treatment products include clonidine and nitroglycerin patches. Patch-based neurological disorder treatment products include those intended to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. Patch-based HRT products include those intended to treat menopause and osteoporosis. Patch-based pain management products include fentanyl and lidocaine patches intended to treat chronic pain. Patch-based genitourinary products include those intended to treat overactive bladder and hypogonadism.

Overall, transdermal drug delivery offers compelling opportunities to address the low bioavailability of many oral drugs; the pain and inconvenience of injections; and the limited controlled release options of both. Building off the successes of first-generation transdermal patches, second-generation chemical enhancers and iontophoresis are expanding delivery capabilities for small molecules, whereas third-generation physical enhancers (including ultrasound, thermal ablation and microneedles) could enable transdermal delivery of macromolecules and vaccines.

The global transdermal drug delivery devices market segmentation is based on technology (passive transdermal transport systems, active transdermal transport systems); clinical application \[cardiovascular disease management (CVD), neurological disorder management, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), pain management, genitourinary disorder management\]; patch-based pharmaceutical products \[clonidine and nitroglycerin products (CVD), neurological disorder treatment products, estrogen replacement products (HRT), pain management products, urologic treatment products\].
