## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Inhalation therapy is the best option for lung diseases like asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Inhalation drug delivery covers many different types of devices: nebulizers, pressurized metered dose inhalers (MDIs), breath-activated inhalers (including dry powder inhalers), and emerging novel delivery systems.

The number of inhaler devices available in the market for inhaled therapies has increased significantly in the past decade. There are two types of nebulizers, jet and ultrasonic, that differ in the force used to generate the aerosol from the respective liquid. Some of the newest nebulizer models in the market include breath-enhanced jet nebulizers such as the Pari LC or Respironics SideStream; breath-actuated nebulizers such as the AeroEclipse; vibrating mesh nebulizers such as Pari eFlow rapid, Omron U22, AKITA2, APIXNEB.

Pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) are the most popular inhalers to treat local respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD. Recently, the use of pMDIs has extended beyond bronchodilators and corticosteroids to deliver proteins, plasmid DNA, and live attenuated virus vaccines or bacteriophages. New pMDIs can be classified as breath-actuated or coordination devices. Breath-actuated pMDIs, such as the Easibreathe, are designed to address the problem of poor coordination between inhaler actuation and patient’s breathe. Spacers and valved holding chambers (VHCs) are used with pMDIs to increase the efficiency of aerosol delivery. Multi-dose liquid inhalers (Respimat Soft Mist inhaler) combines the advantages of pMDIs and nebulizers.

Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are portable devices that require minimum patient coordination between breathing and actuation of the device to deliver powder medications. Thermal vaporization aerosol devices such as STACCATO uses heat to vaporize a thin film of the drug, which later condenses in the lungs into droplets or particles depending on the nature of the drug.

The major problems with the use of inhaler devices are the deposition of aerosolized particles in the oropharyngeal region and upper airways and the lack of coordination between the device activation and inhalation due to lack of patient training. While each device has its own unique combination of device design and drug formulation, all inhalation devices share some common challenges such as drug formulation and aerosolization, consistent drug delivery, and usability.

Millions of people depend on inhalation drug delivery devices to control chronic conditions such as asthma or COPD, as well as treat acute respiratory attacks and infectious diseases. Sensor technologies can help to solve one of the major challenges in inhalation delivery: ensuring consistency of dosage and device performance.
