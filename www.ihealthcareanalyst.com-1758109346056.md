## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Forensic technologies are used for the identification, analysis and evaluation of physical evidence gathered from the crime scene. Such analyzed evidence is further used in criminal law to prove the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Fingerprints, shoeprints, tool marks in case of theft or burglary; or in case with DNA profiles, the bits of evidence are miniaturized to the extent of a single skin cell between the suspect and the crime. Technological advances in DNA profiling such as miniaturization and microchip technologies enable forensic testing and analysis of even micro, old, degraded, decomposed DNA samples. Due to these benefits, the application of DNA profiling as a forensic technology has expanded widely from the identification of suspects in murders, rape cases and violent crimes to exoneration of the wrongfully accused and in establishing an identity for corpses or skeletons and victims of mass disasters.
