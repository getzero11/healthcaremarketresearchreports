Collagen is the primary structural and most important protein of conjunctive tissues and play a key role in making these fundamental components of the human body such as mobile joints, stable bones, smooth skin, glossy hair and healthy fingernails, and thereby ensures the cohesion, elasticity and regeneration of all connective tissues including skin, cartilage and bones.

Collagen products are isolated from various sources such as bovine skin, fish skin, chicken skin, skin waste of marine organisms, solid wastes of leather industry, short tendons of slaughtered cattle and bone. Different types and forms of collagen which are commercially available are distributed in various tissues such as bone, skin, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, blood vessels, vitreous humour in the eye and invertebrate disc.

Collagen products in the form of gel acts as a drug delivery matrix due to its characteristic properties such as flowability, injectability, and biocompatibility. Controlled and sustained release of drugs has shown its importance over conventional ophthalmic preparations due to its reduced side effects, sustained and controlled drug delivery, increased ocular bioavailability and targeted drug delivery.

Tissue engineering is one of the new and emerging technique which helps in the development of new tissues as well as organs. In order to achieve better results, collagen-based scaffolds with good pore size; porosity and pore distribution are prepared to overcome hindrances of the conventional biomaterials.
