## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Cognitive impairment encompasses a range of conditions affecting memory, thinking, and problem-solving abilities, often linked to vascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and child developmental deficiencies.

Vascular-related cognitive decline stems from issues like stroke or small vessel disease, while neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, lead to progressive cognitive deterioration. Psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia or depression can also impair cognition. In children, developmental deficiencies like autism or ADHD impact learning and cognitive function, potentially requiring specialized interventions for management and improvement.
