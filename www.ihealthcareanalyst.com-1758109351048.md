## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is a condition characterized by deficiency of the exocrine pancreatic enzymes. This results in the inability to digest food properly or maldigestion. These enzymes consist of lipases, proteases and amylases. These enzymes primarily consist of lipases for fat digestion, proteases for protein digestion, and amylases for starch digestion. EPI results from various diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, cytomegalovirus infection, and HIV/AIDS.

The pancreatic enzyme products (PEPs) used for PERT are extracts of porcine pancreas that contain all 3 pancreatic enzymes such as amylase, protease, and lipase in varying proportions. A complete laboratory evaluation including pancreatic function testing is required to diagnose EPI and to determine the extent of the malabsorption. At present, six PEPs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of maldigestion in patients are creon, zenpep, pancreaze, ultresa, viokace and pertzye.
