## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Alzheimer’s disease diagnostics focus on identifying early signs of the condition to facilitate timely intervention and care. The process often begins with a thorough medical history review and cognitive assessments to evaluate memory, problem-solving, and language skills. Imaging techniques like MRI and CT scans help detect brain changes, while PET scans can identify amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles, hallmark indicators of the disease. Biomarker analysis through cerebrospinal fluid or blood tests is also emerging as a significant tool for diagnosis.
