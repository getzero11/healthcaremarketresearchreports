Heart valve management surgeries consisting repair or replacement are performed for damaged or diseased valves that may cause heart valve dysfunction (valve stenosis) and valve regurgitation (leaky valve). Heart valve repair is a surgical technique used to fix defects in heart valves in valvular heart diseases, and provides an alternative to valve replacement. The general techniques include either aortic valvuloplasty or mitral valvuloplasty, and valvulotomy.

Heart valve replacement surgery invloves replacement of one or more of the heart valves with either an artificial heart valve or a bioprosthesis (homograft from human tissue or xenograft). The four replacement procedures include aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve replacement, and pulmonary valve replacement. Percutaneous aortic valve replacement (PAVR), or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) involves replacement of the aortic valve of the heart through the blood vessels. The most common valve surgical procedure is aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis, or narrowing of the aortic valve.

More recently, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and transcatheter mitral valve regurgitation therapy (TMVrep) has become a reality. In the recent years, transcatheter heart-valve management procedures with TAVR and TMVrep systems are gaining significant boost in terms of number of procedures performed worldwide due to new device approvals, technological advancements, and rising geriatric population.

The global heart valve management products consisting repair and replacement devices market segmentation is based on product \[traditional invasive (surgical) products (percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty (PBV) systems, heart valve repair (annuloplasty) systems, heart valve replacement products), and emerging minimally invasive transcatheter products (transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), transcatheter mitral valve regurgitation therapy (TMVrep)\].
