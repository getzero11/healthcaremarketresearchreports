$3,000.00

## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

A breathalyzer (breath analyzer) is a device for estimating blood alcohol content (BAC) from a breath sample. Two breathalyzer technologies are most prevalent. Desktop analyzers generally use infrared spectrophotometer technology, electrochemical fuel cell technology, or a combination of the two, whereas the hand-held field testing devices are generally based on electrochemical platinum fuel cell analysis. Public Fuel Cell Breathalyzers are used in pubs, bars, restaurants, charities, weddings and all types of licensed events. A global trend towards excessive alcohol consumption along with rising number of road accidents has led to increase in the usage of breath analyzers. Breath analyzer devices are also gaining importance due to rise in demand for effective detection of BAC level at work places, its non-invasive nature, and being most useful diagnostic tool in the healthcare.
