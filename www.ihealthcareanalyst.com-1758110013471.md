## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have significantly evolved to provide increased data output, efficiencies, and applications. Considering the currently available technologies and related advantages or disadvantages, the use of short-read or long-read sequencing depends on the research or clinical application. The sequence variants/mutations detected by NGS have been widely used for disease diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic decision, and follow up of patients. The capacity of its massive parallel sequencing offers new opportunities for personalized precision medicine.
