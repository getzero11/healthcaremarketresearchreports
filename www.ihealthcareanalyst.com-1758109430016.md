Using endoscopic techniques, the Balloon Sinuplasty system enables to dilate obstructed sinus ostia in patients suffering from sinusitis.

The most common application of this is for chronic sinusitis that has not been able to be controlled after a long duration of medical management that includes long courses of antibiotics. The balloon dilating catheter is a tool to be used in endoscopic sinus surgery. It is the adaptation or application of minimally-invasive balloon technology to the field of sinus surgery.
