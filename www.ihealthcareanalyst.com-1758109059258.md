## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Robotic-assisted surgical systems (RAS), also known as surgical telemanipulation systems or computer-assisted surgery systems can be used for preoperative planning, surgical navigation and to assist in performing different surgical procedures. RAS devices enable the surgeon to use computer and software technology to control and move surgical instruments through one or more tiny incisions (minimally invasive) for a variety of surgical procedures.

Emerging minimally invasive technologies have been embraced by many surgical disciplines over the past few years with a consequent reduction in morbidity and mortality, as well as allowing many patients unfit for conventional surgery to undergo treatment.

The benefits of a RAS device may include its ability to facilitate minimally invasive surgery and assist with complex tasks in confined areas of the body. The device is not actually a robot because it cannot perform surgery without direct human control. Most surgeons use multiple surgical instruments and accessories with the RAS device, such as scalpels, forceps, graspers, dissectors, cautery, scissors, retractors and suction irrigators.

The U.S. FDA has cleared RAS devices for use by trained physicians in an operating room environment for laparoscopic surgical procedures in general surgery cardiac, colorectal, gynecologic, head and neck, thoracic and urologic surgical procedures.

Robotic options do exist for surgical treatment in other specialties although it is used much less frequently. These include cardiothoracic surgery, for cases of coronary bypass and heart defects repairs; general surgical oncology, for esophageal tumors, gastric cancer, colon cancer, thymoma; and pediatrics, to resolve congenital heart diseases, gastroespohageal reflux disease, or uretopelvic junction obstruction.

The global robotic-assisted surgical (RAS) devices market segmentation is based on product (robotic-assisted systems, instruments and accessories, services); clinical application (general surgery, gynecology, urology, orthopedic, neurosurgery, cardiovascular, thoracic, others), end user (hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers), geography.

Robotic-assisted surgical devices and their associated applications include da Vinci (cardiothoracic surgery, general surgery, gynecology, head and neck surgery, and urology), Senhance (general abdominal surgery /laparoscopy and gynecology), MAKO (arthroplasty), Flex Robotic System, Single Port Orifice Robotic Technology (SPORT – general abdominal, gynecology, and urology), Renaissance (brain and spine), ROSA (cranial and spine procedures), SOLOASSIST endoscope holder (general surgery, gynecology, and urology), FlexDex instrument, and NAVIO (arthroplasty).
