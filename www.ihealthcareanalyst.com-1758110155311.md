## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Contrast agents, also known as contrast media, are substances utilized to improve the radiodensity of targeted tissues by modifying how electromagnetic radiation or ultrasound waves traverse the body. These agents can be administered orally, rectally, or intravenously, depending on the imaging technique and the diagnostic objectives. The selection of a specific contrast agent is guided by the imaging modality and the purpose of the procedure, ensuring optimal visualization of the tissues or organs under examination.
