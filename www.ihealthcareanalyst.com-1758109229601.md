## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The transcriptome is the set of all messenger RNA molecules in one cell or a population of cells. It differs from the exome in that it includes only those RNA molecules found in a specified cell population, and usually includes the amount or concentration of each RNA molecule in addition to the molecular identities. The major technologies employed for transcriptome analysis comprises microarrays, PCR, gene regulation studies and next generation sequencing technologies. Gene expression analysis has become easy, cheap, and fast routine due to microarrays and now RNA sequencing, which is helping researchers discover novel RNA forms and variants. New technologies promise to reveal even more about RNA and make RNA-based clinical assays common. High throughput transcriptomics became possible with microarrays, which detect nucleic acids in a sample by hybridization to probes on microchips. Microarrays are particularly useful for analyzing large mammalian transcriptomes, for example in drug development and clinical research that requires rapidly assessing specific genes in thousands of samples.
