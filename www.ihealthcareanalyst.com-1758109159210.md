Aging population is increasing in many developed countries, thus creating the demand for ambient assisted living (AAL) products. The world population is expected to hit 8.6 billion in 2030, 9.8 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in 2100.

Solutions are needed to counteract the associated costs of an older population, where longer life expectancy is often connected to increased frailty, illness or disability amongst those living longer and as such higher costs for health and social care. Products and services may also benefit older people indirectly by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of systems responsible for their wellbeing, health and care.
