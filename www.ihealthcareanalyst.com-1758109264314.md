## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The global 3D printing medical devices market report provides market size ($Million 2023 to 2033), market share, market trends and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).

Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a manufacturing method in which objects are made by fusing or depositing materials like plastic, metal, ceramic, powders, liquids or even living cells in layers to produce a 3D object. It is a revolutionary concept in the field of medicine.

The global 3D printing medical devices market segmentation is based on medical applications (medical implants, dental implants, orthopedic implants, cranio-maxillofacial implants, bio-engineering, surgical guides, orthopedic surgical guides, dental surgical guides, cranio-maxillofacial surgical guides, surgical instruments), technologies (electron beam melting, laser beam melting, photopolymerization, stereolithography, digital light processing, two-photon polymerization, droplet deposition manufacturing, inkjet printing, fused deposition modeling, multiphase jet solidification), and raw materials (metals, polymers, ceramics, biological cells).

The global 3D printing medical devices market research report is divided by geography (regional and country based) into North America (U.S., Canada), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Rest of LA), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Rest of EU), Asia Pacific (Japan, China, India, Rest of APAC), and Rest of the World.

The photopolymerization application segment holds the largest share of the global 3D printing medical devices market, whereas laser beam melting application segment is expected to grow at a faster rate during the forecast period. Similarly, the medical implants segment holds the major market share followed by surgical guide segment. North America dominated the market share of global medical devices 3D printing market followed by Europe and Asia Pacific region.

Major players operating in medical devices 3D printing market and included in the report are 3D System Corporation, Aspect Biosystems, Biogelx Ltd., BIOLIFE4D, Cellink, Envision TEC GmbH, Eos GmbH Electro Optical Systems, Materialise NV, Nanoscibe GmbH, Organovo Holdings Inc., Prellis Biologics, ROKIT Healthcare Inc., Stsratasys Ltd., and Voxeljet Strategies.
