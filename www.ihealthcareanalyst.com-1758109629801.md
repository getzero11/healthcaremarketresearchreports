## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Medicinal radiocompounds or radiopharmaceuticals are a group of pharmaceutical drugs which have radioactivity and they can be used as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Radiopharmaceuticals are used in the field of nuclear medicine as radioactive tracers in medical imaging and functional studies of the brain, myocardium, thyroid, lungs, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, skeleton, blood and tumors, and in therapy for many diseases. Radiopharmaceuticals imply the usage of radiation for non-invasive treatment and diagnosis of various diseases. Utilization of these molecules for medical purposes in PET and SPECT imaging has changed the entire algorithm of disease diagnosis.
