## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Cloud computing in the healthcare industry is a new computing model that lets organizations pay for only the resources when they are needed. With cloud computing, shared resources are allocated dynamically to create a highly flexible environment.  This enables organizations to treat infrastructure as a service, rather than an expensive capital expenditure. There are different models of service delivery: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) as each model brings different requirements and responsibilities. Cloud deployment models (private, public, and hybrid) will also weigh heavily in strategic decisions. Cloud computing provides an infrastructure that allows hospitals, medical practices, insurance companies, and research facilities to tap improved computing resources at lower initial capital outlays.
