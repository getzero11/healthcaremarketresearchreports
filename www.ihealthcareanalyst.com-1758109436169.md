## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Biodegradable stents are being developed as an alternative to permanent stents which may be a potential alternative in solving the problem of in-stent restenosis. Biodegradable materials like polycarbonates, polyesters, corrodible metals and bacterial-derived polymers have been investigated by various research groups in designing stents. A biodegradable stent is considered to be perfect if it could be reliably deployed under the fluoroscopic guidance to locate the target lesion with an insignificant endovascular trauma. In addition, the byproducts developed during the degradation are nontoxic, leading to the minimal inflammation at the target site and disappear in a minimal period of time without a noteworthy displacement from the deployment site. Moreover, stents made of complete polymer may have a higher drug loading capacity, and optimized polymer composition may facilitate more targeted drug delivery, limiting smooth muscle cell proliferation on the abluminal side, while simultaneously encouraging endothelialization on the luminal side.

The global biodegradable stents market segmentation is based on stent type (coronary artery stent, peripheral artery stents), material used (metal based, polycarbonate based, polyester based, polymer based), and end user (ambulatory surgery centers, cardiac catheterization laboratories, hospitals).
