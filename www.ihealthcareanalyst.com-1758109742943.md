## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

There are approximately 100 million people who need insulin around the world. This includes all people living with type 1 diabetes and between 20 to 30 percent of people with type 2 diabetes. Hyperglycemia or high blood sugar is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes, which leads to serious damage to nerves and blood vessels over time. The two major sources of insulin production are human insulin and modern insulin (insulin analogues). The recombinant human segment is being displaced by the more effective but slightly more expensive insulin analogs.

The global insulin market is highly consolidated and is dominated by three major players: Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, and Eli Lilly. Increasing global diabetic population and launch of new highly potent, cost-effective drugs in the pipeline candidates by major pharmaceutical companies are likely to boost the growth of global insulin market.
