Advances in diagnostics technologies and fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of cancer at a molecular level are driving the development of new treatments and diagnostic tests. The introduction and expanding use of molecular diagnostic tests to detect cancer and manage cancer care mark a major milestone and herald future progress in the fight against various cancer diseases. Diagnostics provide critical insights at every stage of cancer care – prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment and successful management. A combination of better prevention, earlier detection, increased public awareness, improved diagnosis, and more advanced therapies are driving progress in the fight against cancer. Diagnostic tests are at the forefront of medical innovation, providing vital insights into patient health and transforming cancer care. Molecular diagnostics have transformed the way to approach cancer care, and promise to be a critical contributor to further progress. It can help differentiate cancer from benign tumors (i.e., growths that are not harmful) and can further help identify the type of tissue in which the cancer originated (e.g., breast, lung, skin, etc.). Molecular diagnostics can even help classify different cancer subtypes that affect the same tissue. With the potential to fundamentally change clinical practice, these technologies are intended to match the right patient with the right treatment at the right time.

However, globally, the number of people being diagnosed with cancer each year continues to rise, and cancer remains a significant public health challenge in part because advances in cancer care have not been uniform across all types of cancer, or among all patients with a certain cancer. Survival rates are affected by the type of cancer, stage at diagnosis, and patient demographics. There is a need for the continued discovery of new biomarkers to fully characterize the many subsets of cancer patients.

The global cancer molecular diagnostics market segmentation is based on technology platform (RT-PCR, DNA microarray, Lab-On-A-Chip (LOAC), next generation sequencing (NGS), multiplex conventional, next generation capture, protein microarray, others); by application or cancer type (breast cancer, colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, precancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, chest cancer, brain cancer, thyroid cancer, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, others).
