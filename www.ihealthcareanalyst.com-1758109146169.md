Migraine is a common and highly disabling neurological disorder. The American Migraine Foundation estimates migraine headaches affect 38 million in US alone, and it is three times more women than men.

Migraine treatment is divided into two paradigms: acute treatment, which is taken as an abortive treatment at the onset of an attack, and prophylactic treatment, which is administered chronically to prevent new migraine attacks. Migraine treatment traditionally includes both preventive therapies, aimed at reducing attack frequency and severity, and acute therapy, for aborting attacks.
