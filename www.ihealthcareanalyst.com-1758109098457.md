## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The treatment of infants, children, and adolescents differ from adults in many aspects of pharmacotherapy, including capabilities for drug administration, medicine-related toxicity, and taste preferences. Pediatric medicines are formulated to best suit a child’s age, size, physiologic condition, and treatment requirements to ensure adequate treatment, different routes of administration, dosage forms, and strengths. Important pharmacokinetic differences between children and adults include the rate of gastric emptying and pH, gastrointestinal permeability, and the surface area available for drug absorption.

Pediatric drug development has experienced dramatic advances in the last two decades. The adoption of pediatric regulatory initiatives in the US and then in Europe has significantly changed the worldwide legislative frameworks. New regulations, additional funding opportunities, and innovative collaborative research initiatives have resulted in some recent progress in the development of pediatric formulations. These advances include a paradigm shift toward oral solid formulations and a focus on novel preparations, including flexible, dispersible, and multiparticulate oral solid dosage forms.

Most commonly prescribed pediatric medications include amoxicillin, azithromycin, albuterol, amoxicillin/ clavulanate, cefdinir, cephalexin, fluticasone, prednisolone sodium phosphate, ibuprofen, singulair (montelukast sodium), trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole, codeine phosphate/ acetaminophen, hydrocodone bitartrate/ acetaminophen, nystatin, methylphenidate, dextromethorphan/ phenylephrine/ chlorpheniramin, mometasone, triamcinolone, prednisone, sodium fluoride, multivitamins with fluoride, amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine, hydrocortisone, budesonide, ciprofloxacin/ dexamethasone, promethazine, prednisolone, antipyrine/ benzocaine, and lisdexamfetamine.
