## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Molecular biological techniques are at the forefront as they have the advantage of providing a combined research of molecular as well as cytological approach. Introduction of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) technologies have contributed significantly to the molecular cytogenetics market in the diagnostics and research sectors. FISH and aCGH diagnostic techniques are considered as excellent diagnostic tools because of their ability to provide accurate diagnosis in a short span of time. Cytogenetic analyses are considered mandatory part for leukemia diagnosis.

Introduction of advanced technologies enable healthcare professionals in detecting chromosomal abnormalities and hidden chromosome aberrations in patients. FISH has provided significant advances in both research and diagnosis of genetic abnormalities, hematological malignancies and solid tumors. aCGH is preferred over other techniques due to its ability to detect deletion, duplication or amplification at a sub-microscopic level. Globally rising number of cancer cases, genetic disorders, hematological malignancies and technological advancements are some of the factors contributing to the global molecular cytogenetics market.
