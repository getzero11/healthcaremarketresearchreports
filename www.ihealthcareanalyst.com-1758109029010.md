## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Interventional cardiology includes heart diagnostics and non-surgical therapeutics such as catheter-based procedures and the use of minimally-invasive instruments and devices to restore healthy blood flow to the heart, repair or replace damaged or failing heart valves, reverse dangerous conditions such as congestive heart failure, reduce risk of heart attacks and strokes, save limbs, eliminate pain and improve mobility. Diagnostic interventional cardiology includes coronary angiogram to determine any blockage to arteries and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to evaluate a heart’s arteries. Minimally-invasive heart surgery and treatment consists of cardiac catheterization to diagnose or treat certain heart conditions, angioplasty and stent placement (percutaneous coronary intervention or PCI) to restore healthy blood flow to the heart, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) to open narrowed or blocked carotid arteries, angioplasty and stent placement to open narrowed or blocked peripheral arteries, rotational atherectomy to remove calcified lesions from arteries, percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty to open a narrowed or blocked heart valve, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR/TAVI)  to replace an aortic valve, also as an alternative to open-heart surgery for high-risk patients, and adult heart structural procedures to treat congenital heart defects such as aortic valve stenosis, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or pulmonary valve stenosis and other adult congenital heart defects. The U.S. market for interventional cardiology devices is driven by the population at risk of developing angina or suffering from myocardial infarction, which encompasses men over 45 or women over 55 years of age.

The global interventional cardiology diagnostic and therapeutic devices market segmentation is based on diagnostic devices (coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound, guidewire-based physiologic intravascular stenosis assessment, optical coherence tomography, intracardiac echocardiography), therapeutic devices type (coronary stent systems, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty devices, coronary atherectomy systems – laser atherectomy systems, mechanical atherectomy systems, ­transcatheter septal defect repair devices, ­coronary thrombectomy systems).
