Patient care providers require handling, lifting, and mobilizing patients, which increases the risk of musculoskeletal injuries. Lifting and moving heavy loads increases the potential for injury for both the care taker and the patient. Safe patient handling and mobility have proven effective in reducing employee injuries; benefits have also included improvements in patient safety, decreased falls, increased strength, and decreased skin breakdown/impairments, and improvements in other negative healthcare outcomes related to immobility.

In order to reduce cost of lifting and repositioning injuries to care takers, medical organizations and national regulating bodies, such as the [American Nurses Association (ANA)](https://www.nursingworld.org/) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have developed and provided guidance in the form of staff education, policies, and procedures to help reduce the risk of injuries.

There are numerous categories of equipment that can be utilized separately or in conjunction with one another to allow safe mobility and care for patients. The choice of equipment are based on patients’ strengths and weaknesses and functional ability. For example, the most common lifting device used is a full-body lift for highly dependent patients. They can be used to move patients out of beds, into and out of chairs, for toileting and bathing tasks, repositioning, lifting appendages, lifting a patient off of the floor after a fall, and vehicle transfers. These lifts are available with many features, and there are a wide variety of sling types (toileting, ambulating, amputee, repositioning, turning, limb, etc.) that can be used for patients of different sizes, medical conditions, and physical limitations. Most full-body and sit-to-stand lifts, as well as some stand aids, use slings for patient lifting, support, or positioning. Powered standing-assist devices are useful in moving partially-dependent patients.
