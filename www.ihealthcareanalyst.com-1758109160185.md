## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that progressively takes away the ability to move. It is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability. PD is the second most common neurologic disease following Alzheimer’s disease. It is incurable, but non-fatal, resulting in poor quality of life and increasing disability as the disease progresses.

Parkinson’s disease currently affects 13 million people worldwide and, due to an aging population, is estimated to affect 32 million by 2050. Parkinson’s disease affects about 50 percent more men than women.

According to [The Michael J. Fox Foundation](https://www.michaeljfox.org), PD affects as many as 1.5 million people in the United States, with about 60,000 additional patients newly diagnosed each year. Parkinson’s disease is the [14th leading](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs) cause of death in the United States.

Gold-standard treatment (Levodopa) helps to partially recover movement but presents critical unmet needs. PD is predominantly treated with mature therapies such as levodopa and dopamine agonist (pramipexole and ropinirole). The market is therefore dominated by generics, with Teva’s Azilect (rasagiline) being the last lucrative drug indicated for all Parkinson’s disease patients.

The Parkinson’s disease pipeline is characterized by a high level of both growth and attrition. Most Parkinson’s disease pipeline candidates are in the preclinical stages of development; however, many programs fail to progress into later stages. several barriers to developing therapies for Parkinson’s exist, including a lack of a clear understanding about the biological processes leading to cell death in Parkinson’s, inadequate translational research, and a lack of a biomarker for determining disease progression and severity.

Clinical trials face difficulties including a high placebo response and poor recruitment of patients. The long duration and slow progressive course of the disease are key factors resulting in clinical trials requiring an extensive number of resources. Future clinical trials should aim to target a defined patient population.
