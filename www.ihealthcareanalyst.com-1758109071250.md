## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Drug delivery mechanisms using aerosols are an integral part of the treatment of respiratory disorders (e.g. asthma, obstructive lung disorders, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, infectious pulmonary disease). Inhalation drug delivery devices such as MDIs, DPIs and nebulizers have been a large part of asthma/ COPD inhaler success over the last 10 years.

Nebulizers, Spacers and Valved Holding Chambers (VHCs) are medical devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration and available by prescription. Increasing prevalence of asthma, COPD and other respiratory diseases coupled with rising awareness is predicted to increase usages of respiratory inhaler devices worldwide, and thereby bolster the [inhalation drug delivery devices market](https://www.ihealthcareanalyst.com/report/inhalation-drug-delivery-devices-market/) growth over the next five to six years. North America accounts for the highest number of asthma and COPD cases in the world. For instance, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published in 2012, that around 18.7 million adults in the U.S. suffering from [asthma](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/asthma.htm). The [American Lung Association](http://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/) states that [COPD](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/copd.htm) is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. every year. Additionally, one in 30 persons in the U.S. was a carrier of cystic fibrosis (CFTR gene), while nearly 30,000 people suffered from cystic fibrosis, according to a report published by the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) in 2012.
