## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Motion sickness is a common syndrome caused by conflict between the vestibular, visual, and other proprioceptive systems. Prevention of motion sickness is more effective than treating symptoms. Medications are most effective when taken prophylactically before traveling, or as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. Women are more sensitive to motion sickness than men, and pregnant women are especially at risk for motion sickness.

Scopolamine, an anticholinergic, is a first-line medication for prevention of motion sickness and should be administered transdermally several hours before the anticipated motion exposure. First-generation antihistamines, such as Cyclizine (Marezine), dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and meclizine (Antivert) are also effective. Oral anticholinergic formulations are not available in the United States, since it causes more dry eyes and dry mouth than antihistamines, but less sedation than antihistamines, and not recommended for children younger than 10 years.
