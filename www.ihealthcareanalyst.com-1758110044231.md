Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by brief interruptions of breathing during sleep. Obstructive, central and complex sleep apnea are the three major types of sleep apnea.

The diagnostic devices aids in determination of sleep apnea and enable the sleep specialist to record the critical information effectively. Depending on symptoms, the type of therapeutic devices is recommended. Two of the most widely used and most effective treatment options are continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and dental appliances, or mouth guards.
