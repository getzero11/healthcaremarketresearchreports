Osteoporosis may be caused due to lower than normal peak bone mass and greater than normal bone loss. It is a chronic and life-threatening disease, in which microstructure of bones is altered due to reduction in bone mass and bone density. The condition leads to increased bone fragility and threat of bone cracks and fractures. Therefore, it is considered life threatening due to severe injury and associated pain. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, surgical removal of the ovaries, and kidney disease. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and steroids.
