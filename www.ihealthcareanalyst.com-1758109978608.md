$3,000.00

## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Non-surgical fat reduction includes minimally invasive treatments that selectively break down fat cells in specific areas to reduce the size of subcutaneous fat pockets (fat deposits that sit beneath the skin, but above the muscle).

A number of FDA cleared treatments are available, each achieving gradual, modest fat loss without surgery or downtime. No cosmetic procedure, surgical or non-surgical, is intended for weight loss. The treatments do not significantly change a patient’s weight, and a healthy lifestyle and weight maintenance are essential to maintain results.
