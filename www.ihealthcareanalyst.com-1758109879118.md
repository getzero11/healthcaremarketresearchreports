Trocars are used during laparoscopic procedures and other minimally invasive surgery (MIS) to make small, puncture like incisions in outer tissue layers. These incisions allow surgeons to insert cannulas through which surgical instruments can be introduced. MIS procedures allow faster recovery times than traditional open procedures as well as minimal patient discomfort.

Trocars enable the laparoscopist to introduce working instruments into the gas-filled abdomen or retroperitoneum. They also maintain the pneumoperitoneum by conveying the insufflant and may serve as pathways for delivering small amounts of dissected tissue from the surgical area.

A variety of non-disposable (reusable) and disposable trocars are available with one-way valves and multiseal valves. Standard models range from 3 to 20 mm in diameter and 5 to 20 cm in length. Originally, only “cutting,” sharp-tipped or bladed, trocars were available. However, bladed trocars have been superseded by safer noncutting dilating trocars (i.e., blunt), which no longer require a safety shield. In addition, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated a lower relative risk of trocar site bleeding and overall complications with blunt compared with bladed trocars.

Other blunt-tipped trocars are produced by all of the major trocar manufacturers. These devices have a variety of tips that enable their placement by spreading the tissues; some also have a clear plastic tip (i.e., optical trocar) so that the surgeon can pass an endoscope into the trocar to endoscopically monitor its passage through the abdominal wall and its entry into the gas-filled abdomen.

Trocars are used in medicine to access and drain collections of fluid such as in a patient with hydrothorax or ascites. In modern times, surgical trocars are used to perform laparoscopic surgery. They are deployed as a means of introduction for cameras and laparoscopic hand instruments, such as scissors, graspers, etc., to perform surgery hitherto carried out by making a large abdominal incision, which has revolutionized patient care.

Today, surgical trocars are most commonly a single patient use instrument and have graduated from the “three-point” design that gave them their name to either a flat bladed “dilating-tip” product or something that is entirely blade free. This latter design offers greater patient safety due to the technique used to insert them.
