Microbial cultures are used to determine the type of organism, and also its abundance in the sample being tested. It is one of the primary diagnostic methods of microbiology and used as a tool to determine the cause of infectious diseases by allowing the agent multiply in a predefined medium. Microbiology culture is a process of multiplying microbial organisms by allowing them to reproduce in predetermined culture media under controlled laboratory conditions.

It is one of the principal diagnostic methods of microbiology used to determine the cause of infectious diseases by culturing the pathogen in a preset medium. One of the most important reasons for culturing microorganisms such as bacteria in vitro is for diagnosis of infectious diseases. Similarly, cultured bacteria are used to obtain antigens from developing serological assays or vaccines.

Microorganisms are required to have an effective metabolism along with high productivity to achieve an economical production process. Microbiological culture media consist of various nutrient substances supporting the growth of particular types of microorganisms. Some media contain solutions of inorganic salts and may be supplemented with one or more organic compounds. Other media are prepared from complex in-gradients such as amino acids, vitamins, and protein extracts of plant and animal tissues.
