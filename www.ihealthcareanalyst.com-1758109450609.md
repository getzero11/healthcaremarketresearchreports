## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Melanoma is a skin cancer that forms in the cells responsible for skin pigmentation, known as melanocytes. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S., accounting for almost half of all cancers. A number of dermatology-specific smartphone apps have been developed to assess certain skin changes and inform individuals whether such changes warrant a visit to a dermatologist for further analysis. The published studies suggest that, at this point, there is large variability in the sensitivity and specificity of these applications for melanoma detection. As such, reliance on these applications is not warranted. Although many health professionals have raised concerns regarding the reliance on skin cancer apps, others have praised such apps in terms of potentially raising awareness among the general public and encouraging patients to visit a dermatologist for assessment.
