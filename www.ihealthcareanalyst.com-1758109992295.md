## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Vaccine manufacturing is one of the most challenging industries. Even the most basic manufacturing steps necessary to produce vaccines in a manner that is safe, effective, and consistent over the life cycle of a vaccine are difficult to execute.

Leading multinational corporations have good understanding of the complex manufacturing processes, high technological and R&D barriers to entry, and the costs associated with vaccine production. Given the importance of vaccines in public health programs, governments and donors have invested in vaccine R&D and production in low-resource settings.
