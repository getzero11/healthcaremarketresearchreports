Cardiac stress test or cardiac diagnostic test involves measuring heart’s ability to respond to external stress in a controlled clinical environment, which is either induced by exercise or by drug stimulation. Cardiopulmonary stress testing is performed to evaluate exercise capacity and predict outcome in patients diagnosed with heart failure.

The cardiac stress test is done with heart stimulation, either by exercise on a treadmill, with the patient connected to an electrocardiogram (ECG). Cardiopulmonary stress testing (CPST) plays an important role in the detection of ischemic heart disease, heart failure, shortness of breath, asthma, and other pulmonary disorders. CPST is a non-invasive and highly sensitive stress test that assesses the response of pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurophysiological, hematopoietic, and skeletal muscle systems to exercise.
