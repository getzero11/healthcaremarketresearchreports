Prenatal diagnosis or prenatal screening refers to testing for diseases or conditions in a fetus or embryo before it is born. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) test can detect birth defects such as neural tube defects, Down syndrome, chromosome abnormalities, genetic disorders and other conditions, such as spina bifida, cleft palate, Tay–Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, Muscular dystrophy, and fragile X syndrome. NIPT is used for screening pregnant women at high risk of developing fetal chromosomal aneuploidies such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), and Turner syndrome (monosomy X) along with fetal sex determination. Amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), maternal serum screening, and nuchal translucency (NT) scan have been the primary diagnostic and screening methods for chromosomal abnormalities. NIPT is an innovative way of screening pregnancies for fetal chromosomal aneuploidies by analyzing fetal cell-free DNA circulating in maternal blood.
