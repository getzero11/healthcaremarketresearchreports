## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a laboratory technique used to detect and locate a specific DNA sequence on a chromosome. It is utilized to diagnose genetic diseases, gene mapping, and identification of chromosomal abnormalities, and may also be used to study comparisons among the chromosomes’ arrangements of genes of related species.

FISH is often used for finding specific features in DNA for use in genetic counseling, medicine, and species identification. FISH can also be used to detect and localize specific RNA targets (mRNA, lncRNA and miRNA) in cells, circulating tumor cells, and tissue samples. In this context, it can help define the spatial-temporal patterns of gene expression within cells and tissues.
