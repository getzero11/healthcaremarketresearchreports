## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Nausea and vomiting are serious side effects of cancer chemotherapy that can cause significant negative impacts on patients’ quality of life and on their ability to tolerate and comply with therapy. Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) can be defined as acute CINV, delayed CINV or anticipatory CINV. Antiemetic agents are the most common intervention in the management of treatment-related nausea and vomiting (N&V) that completely block the peripheral neuroreceptors and the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) that are known to contain receptors for serotonin, histamine (H1 and H2), dopamine, acetylcholine, opioids, and numerous other endogenous neurotransmitters.

The global chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting drugs market report provides market size ($Million 2023 to 2033), market share, market trends and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).

The global chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting drugs market segmentation is based on major drugs (Marketed Drugs, and Pipeline Drugs). The global chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting drugs market research report is divided by geography (regional and country based) into North America (U.S., Canada), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Rest of LA), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Rest of EU), Asia Pacific (Japan, China, India, Rest of APAC), and Rest of the World.

The currently available chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting drugs do not effectively address the symptoms of this condition compared to pipeline drugs, as demonstrated in the clinical studies. Aloxi (palonosetron), Zofran generic (ondansetron), Kytril generic (granisetron), Emend (aprepitant) and Akynzeo (netupitantpalonosetron FDC) are currently approved marketed CINV drugs, while the major pipeline drugs such as SUSTOL (extended release generic granisetron) and rolapitant are expected to be approved in the near future. The stringent regulatory approval process and high cost associated with new drug discovery and development are also expected to affect market growth during the forecast period.

Major players operating in the global chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting drugs market and included in this report are GlaxoSmithKline plc, Helsinn Holding S.A., Heron Therapeutics, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Tesaro, Inc.
