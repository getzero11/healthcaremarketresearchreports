Human vaccines are dead or inactivated organisms or purified products derived from them. There are several types of vaccines currently in use. These represent different strategies used to try to reduce risk of illness, while retaining the ability to induce a beneficial immune response. A conjugate vaccine is created by covalently attaching a poor antigen to a strong antigen thereby eliciting a stronger immunological response to the antigen, such as a polysaccharide that is attached to strong protein antigen. Inactivated vaccines are produced by killing the disease-causing microbe with chemicals, heat, or radiation. Such vaccines are more stable and safer than live vaccines.

Live, attenuated vaccines contain a version of the living microbe that has been weakened in the lab so it can’t cause disease. Instead of the entire microbe, subunit vaccines include only the antigens that best stimulate the immune system. Synthetic vaccine mainly consists of synthetic peptides, carbohydrates, or antigens, and they are usually considered to be safer than vaccines from bacterial cultures. New safe and effective vaccines are being developed for a variety of infections and parasites against which no effective preventive intervention measure is either available or practical.

The global human vaccines market segmentation is based on vaccine type (conjugate vaccines, inactivated or killed vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, synthetic vaccines, others), and disease type (hepatitis, human papilloma virus, influenza, pneumonia, others).
