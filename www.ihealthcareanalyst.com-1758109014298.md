Genomic sequencing technologies have revolutionized biology, with impacts ranging from the sequencing of several model genomes to the birth of a new era for pharmacogenomics. In recent years, there has been an increasing fragmentation of the GS technologies market as several competing manufacturers launched NGS platforms. It is noteworthy that more than a decade after the completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP), the majority of genomic sequencing (GS) technologies on the market are still used for research purposes. The high-throughput – next generation sequencing (HT-NGS) technologies are currently the hottest topic in the field of human and animal genomics researches, which can produce over 100 times more data compared to the most sophisticated capillary sequencers based on the Sanger method. The HT-NGS technologies are revolutionizing the human and animal genome researches by analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to DNA microarray (ChIP-chip) or sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), whole genome genotyping, genome wide structural variation, de novo assembling and re-assembling of genome, mutation detection and carrier screening, detection of inherited disorders and complex human diseases, DNA library preparation, paired ends and genomic captures, sequencing of mitochondrial genome and personal genomics. In the future of personalized medicine, whole genome sequence data will be an important tool to guide therapeutic intervention.
