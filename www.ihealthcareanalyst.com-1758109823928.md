## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Needleless connectors offer a safe way to access IV lines without the use of a needle, which greatly reduces the risk of accidental needle-stick injuries and bacterial contamination among health care providers. Needleless connectors also provide convenience to the nursing staff in administering medication and drawing blood from the attached catheter.

Within a single health care system, several types of needleless connectors may be in use, varying considerably in both design and function. Needleless connectors are widely used in acute care hospitals, wherein administration of medications and drawing of blood are essential during the hospital stay of patients.

While needleless connectors have greatly reduced the risk of needle stick injury among health care providers, they have also been associated with an increase in such complications as catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) and catheter lumen occlusions.

The global needle-free connectors market report estimates the market size ($million 2023 to 2033), market share, growth trends and forecast (CAGR% 2025 to 2033).
