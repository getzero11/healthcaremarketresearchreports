## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) caused by enteric pathogens, such as Salmonella spp., Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC), and Campylobacter spp., has traditionally been based on culture methods from patients with culture-confirmed infections. Enteric infections enter the body through the mouth and intestinal tract and are usually spread through contaminated food and water or by contact with infected person. Intestinal infections can range from asymptomatic and mild to severe symptoms including abdominal cramps, vomiting, nausea and anorexia. Infectious enteric diseases are usually caused by a variety of bacteria, viruses and parasites when they enter the body through mouth and intestinal tract, primarily as a result of ingesting contaminated food and liquids. The global enteric disease testing market report focuses on the major diseases such as campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, amebiasis, norovirus infection and clostridium difficile mediated infection. All age groups are susceptible to enteric diseases; however small children, elderly people and diseased people are at high risk of contracting infection due to weakened immune systems.

The global enteric disease testing market report estimates the market size ($million 2023 to 2033) for market segmentation based on causal organism for enteric disease type (bacterial agents –  C. difficile, Campylobacteriosis, Cholera, E. coli, H. pylori, Salmonellosis, Shigellosis; viral agents – Norovirus, Rotavirus; and parasitic agents – Amebiasis, Cryptosporidiosis, Giardiasis), and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).
