## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Neuroscience is a rapidly advancing field that is revolutionizing the way we diagnose and treat neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. One of the key areas of innovation is in diagnostic solutions, which are crucial for early detection and accurate diagnosis of these complex conditions.

Molecular diagnostics, such as biomarker testing, are playing an increasingly important role in CNS disease diagnosis. Non-molecular diagnostics, like imaging techniques (CT, MRI) and neurophysiology tests (EEG, EMG), provide essential information about the structure and function of the nervous system.

In terms of therapies, drug treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders like depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia are constantly being improved and refined. Researchers are also making progress in developing drugs for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis. Non-drug therapies, including behavioral therapy services and digital health solutions, are also proving effective in managing symptoms and improving quality of life for patients. These innovations have the potential to dramatically improve the lives of millions of people affected by neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.
