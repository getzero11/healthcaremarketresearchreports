Antimicrobial susceptibility tests (AST) are used to determine sensitiveness of specific antibiotics a particular bacteria or fungus. The tests can guide the physician in drug choice and dosage for difficult-to-treat infections. Factors affecting antibiotic susceptibility testing include pH, moisture, effects of medium components, and amount of organism. AST results are often used for specific management for individual patients, and summary AST data is used to drive empiric antimicrobial therapy, or to detect resistance in individual bacterial isolates.

The most widely used testing methods include broth microdilution or rapid automated instrument methods that use commercially marketed materials and devices. The advantages of the dilution procedure include the generation of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the reproducibility and convenience of having pre-prepared panels, and the economy of reagents and space that occurs due to the miniaturization of the test. Manual methods that provide flexibility and possible cost savings include the disk diffusion and gradient diffusion methods.

The Etest (bioMérieux AB BIODISK) is a commercial version of antimicrobial gradient diffusion method available in the United States. Use of instrumentation can standardize the reading of end points and often produce susceptibility test results in a shorter period than manual readings because sensitive optical detection systems allow detection of subtle changes in bacterial growth. The MicroScan WalkAway (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics), BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (BD Diagnostics), Vitek 2 System (bioMérieux), Sensititre ARIS 2X (Trek Diagnostic Systems) are the examples of automated instrument systems.

Each method has strengths and weaknesses, including organisms that may be accurately tested by the method. Some methods provide quantitative results, and all provide qualitative assessments using the categories susceptible, intermediate, or resistant. In general, current testing methods provide accurate detection of common antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. However, newer or emerging mechanisms of resistance require constant vigilance regarding the ability of each test method to accurately detect resistance.
