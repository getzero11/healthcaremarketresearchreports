## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Otoscopy is a clinical procedure used to examine structures of the ear, particularly the external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, and middle ear. The otoscope contains a light and magnifying lens to illuminate and enlarge ear structures to help the provider accurately visualize and evaluate the health of the visible anatomical structures. Clinicians use the process during routine wellness physical exams and the evaluation of specific ear complaints.

Otoscopy is routinely performed during wellness check-ups and in evaluating specific ear complaints by both specialists, such as ear, nose, and throat physicians (ENTs) and primary care providers. Otoscopy plays a significant role in diagnosing several ear conditions and is a key step for the diagnosis of some conditions such as acute otitis media
