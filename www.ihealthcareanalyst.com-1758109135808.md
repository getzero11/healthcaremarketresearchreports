Linear accelerators for medical and industrial applications have become an important commercial business. Linear accelerator is a device which destroys the cancer cells without affecting the surrounding normal cells. Approximately 60 percent of all cancer cases in the U.S. involve some form of radiation therapy, and recent technological improvements by linear accelerator manufacturers allow for unprecedented accuracy and safety in treating tumors, and limiting effects on the surrounding normal tissue.

Linear accelerator (LINAC) functions in a way that it accelerates electrons through a linear tube with high speeds resulting in x-rays emission. Higher x-rays generate large electronic potential which is useful in longer accelerating cavity resulting in greater efficiency for destruction of tumors. Several linacs also emit electron beams. The product comprises four prime components such as modulator, radio-frequency, electron gun, power source and accelerator. Linacs are thus classified according to their energy levels, low, medium and high. The largest single medical application for linacs is radiation therapy.

Linacs are used in medical field having a uniform X-ray photon radiation of different energies that depend on the accelerator. LINAC can be utilized on any part of human body with greater efficiency for brain tumor applications. Linear accelerators and cobalt radiotherapy units are used against cancer treatment resulting into treatment of bone cancers and tumours in head, neck and breast. High-energy linacs are used against deep-seated neoplasms and tumours of thorax and pelvis. Radiation therapy is used in cancer treatment all across the globe, which can either be comforting or curative, depending on the level and scenario of the ailment.
