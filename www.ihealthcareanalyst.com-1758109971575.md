## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis (NCFBE) is a common respiratory condition, characterized by abnormal bronchial dilatation, that often leads to recurrent airway infection and inflammation. It is an increasingly recognized respiratory condition, both as a primary lung disease but also co-existing with other respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Diagnosis can have important treatment implications.

There are shared systematic approaches to treatment, such as sputum clearance techniques, prompt treatment of exacerbations and, in certain circumstances, regular antibiotic therapy. First-line therapy is airway clearance. In patients whose symptoms are not improving, mucolytics or long-term antibiotics should be considered.

Pulmonary exacerbations should be treated promptly with appropriate antibiotics by the appropriate route and at the correct dose and course length. Surgical treatment has to be considered a last resort in case of hemoptysis, recurring severe pneumonia or secondary aspergilloma with complete resection of all pathological findings, ideally by minimally-invasive approach.
