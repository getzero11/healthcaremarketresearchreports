## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Robots in laboratory, life science and pharmaceutical applications perform tasks in potentially hazardous settings in proximity to biological dangers, the threat of radioactive contamination, and toxic chemotherapy compounds. Robotics are used to assemble and package a variety of medical devices and implants as well as preparing prescriptions for mail-order pharmacies or hospitals. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are creating special purpose robots that can be used in the pharmaceutical environment. Robots lend speed, accuracy, repeatability, and safety in automation as well as cost reduction to the pharmaceutical manufacturing and verification processes.

Some of the examples of FDA approved robot models for pharmaceutical specialized environment include ABB, Fanuc, Stäubli, and Motoman. For example, Stäubli robots offer ultra-short cycle times with maximum output in handling and packaging of IV bags, syringes and vials, aseptic dispensing or loading and unloading of insulators in drug production. Robot types include articulated, Cartesian (gantry), parallel (delta), and selective compliance assembly robot arm (SCARA). Common applications include high-speed picking and packaging operations that often use SCARA and delta-type robots. Fanuc delta robots are used in bottling line to place dispenser caps onto bottled allergy medications. An increase in the use of robots is seen in dispensing, sorting, kit assembly, and light machine-tending as well as in more traditional applications associated with packaging. Automated syringe assembly, inspection, and preparation for packaging is an ideal application for robotics. Vision-sensing technology can be used in pharmaceutical packaging to verify serialization numbers for compliance with track-and-trace regulations.

The many benefits of automation include efficiency, saving workers from hazardous environments or repetitive tasks, reducing training overhead, eliminating human error, increasing repeatability and reproducibility, and in cleanrooms, removing the potential for human contamination.
