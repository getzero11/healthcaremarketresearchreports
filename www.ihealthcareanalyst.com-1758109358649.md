Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cells that have shed into the vasculature or lymphatics from a primary tumor and are carried around the body in the circulation. Circulating tumor cells (can be detected in the circulation, where the detection of CTCs in blood can provide prognostic information. Advanced technologies emerge to characterize CTCs at the molecular level, where the biological information can be obtained in real time. There is a great potential of CTCs to be used as pharmacodynamics and predictive biomarkers and potentially their use in revealing drug resistance in real time. Monitoring CTCs predicts the metastatic tumor progression in prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian and pancreatic cancer.

The global circulating tumor cells prognostic technologies market segmentation is based on technology tumor cell enrichment, centrifugation, filtration, immunological methods, tumor cell detection, molecular methods, optical methods), and its application (breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer, etc.).
