## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The majority of colorectal cancers begin as benign growths in the lining of the large bowel wall called adenomatous polyps. Over the years (at least ten years), these polyps grow in size and number, thereby increasing the risk that the cells in the polyps will become cancerous and invade the wall and move on to other organs. Approximately two thirds of these cancers are found in the large intestine and one third in the rectum.

Early removal of these growths will prevent colorectal cancer from developing in the first place. Hence, identification and removal of polyps are key to preventing the development of colorectal cancer. Screening for colorectal cancer allows for the early detection of cancer when it is highly curable, as well as the detection of growths (polyps) that might eventually become cancer.

Currently, two types of FOBT are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to screen for colorectal cancer: guaiac FOBT (gFOBT) and the fecal immunochemical (or immunohistochemical) test (FIT, also known as iFOBT).
