## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Surgical drainage devices are used to monitor for a postoperative leak or abscess, collect normal physiologic fluid or to minimize dead space. Surgical drains are commonly used following elective abdominal, cardiothoracic, orthopedic, and breast surgery. Abdominal and chest drains are commonly used in both elective and emergency surgery as well use in chest trauma or in the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax.

Surgical drainage systems are a common feature of post-operative surgical management and are used to remove drainage from a wound bed to prevent infection and the delay of wound healing. Number of drainage devices are available from various manufacturers, varying in overall shape and size. The most significant difference between devices is the presence or absence of a flow-restricting valve. High- and low-pressure vacuum drains are commonly used after surgical procedures. High-pressure vacuum drains (sealed, closed-circuit systems) are efficient and allow for easy monitoring and safe disposal of the drainage. Low-pressure vacuum drains use gentle pressure to evacuate excess fluid and air, and are easy for patients to manage at home because it is easy to reinstate the vacuum pressure.
