A rapidly emerging immunotherapy approach is called adoptive cell transfer (ACT): collecting and using patients own immune cells to treat their cancer. Until recently, the use of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has been restricted to small clinical trials, largely in patients with advanced blood cancers. But these treatments have nevertheless captured the attention of researchers and the public alike because of the remarkable responses they have produced in some patients – both children and adults – for whom all other treatments had stopped working.

In 2017, two CAR T-cell therapies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), one for the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the other for adults with advanced lymphomas. Kymriah (Novartis) received FDA approval for pediatric patients and young adults (up to age 25 years) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The second-to-market CAR T cell therapy, Yescarta (Kite Pharma/Gilead Sciences), was granted FDA approval for adults with R/R B cell lymphoma, including DLBCL and other aggressive NHL subtypes, after at least two lines of systemic therapy. Both Kymriah and Yescarta are available through a restricted program that includes a risk evaluation mitigation strategy to address the severe and life-threatening side effects of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Research on CAR T cells is continuing at a swift pace, mostly in patients with blood cancers, but also in patients with solid tumors. The CAR T cell therapy pipeline includes JCAR017, UCART19, bb2121, LCAR-B38M, KITE-585, AUTO2, MB-102, UCART123, CD33-targeted CAR, BPX601, JCAR020, CAR-EGFR/EGFRvIII T, MB-101, JCAR023, CAR CLD18 T cells, and AU105 in the phase I and II development.

The global chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy market segmentation is based on drug class (CAR T cell therapy, biologics, cytotoxic agents, small molecules); by indication – acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and multiple myeloma (MM).
