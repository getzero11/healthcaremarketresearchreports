## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Medical devices are indispensable for cancer management across the entire cancer care continuum. Oncology devices and diagnostics include a range of medical devices, in vitro diagnostics and combination device products that assist patients and providers in screening, diagnosing, treating, and monitoring premalignant and malignant conditions.

The World Health Organization ([WHO](https://www.who.int/medical_devices/publications/priority_med_dev_cancer_management/en/)) addresses medical devices that can be used for management of cancer and specifically describes medical devices for six types of cancer: breast, cervical, colorectal, leukemia, lung and prostate. The selection of appropriate medical devices at all income and hospital levels has been difficult because of the extremely large number of devices needed for the full spectrum of cancer care; the wide variety of options within the medical device sector, ranging from small inexpensive disposable devices to sophisticated diagnostic imaging and treatment units; and insufficient in-country expertise, in many countries, to prioritize cancer interventions and to determine associated technologies.

The global oncology devices market research report provides market size ($million 2023 to 2033), market share analysis, growth trends and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).

The global cancer devices market segmentation is based on product – directed energy-based therapy devices \[thermal ablation catheter and devices (microwave ablation catheters and devices, radiofrequency ablation catheters and devices, cryoablation catheters and devices, ultrasound ablation catheters and devices, laser ablation devices)\], radiation therapy devices (internal radiation devices), surgical procedure devices \[robotically assisted surgical systems (biopsy systems and devices)\], drug/ fluid delivery and infusion therapy devices \[energy-based drug delivery (electroporation devices)\], in vitro diagnostic assays and tests \[nucleic acid amplification assays (nucleic acid test / nucleic acid amplification tests)\], end user (hospitals, cancer research institutes, others), and geography.

The global carcinoma devices (diagnostic and therapeutic) market research report is further segmented by geography into North America (U.S., Canada), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Rest of EU), Asia Pacific (Japan, China, India, Rest of APAC), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Rest of LA), and Rest of the World.
