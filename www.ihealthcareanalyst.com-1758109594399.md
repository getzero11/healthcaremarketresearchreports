## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The type of diabetes determines either blood sugar monitoring, insulin or oral medications as a treatment. Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump, frequent blood sugar checks, and carbohydrate counting.

Treatment of type 2 diabetes primarily involves monitoring of blood sugar, along with diabetes medications, insulin or both. The elevated sugar level leads to various symptoms such as increased thirst, weight loss, high appetite, frequent and sweet smelled urination. If untreated, diabetes causes various acute and chronic life-threatening complications.
