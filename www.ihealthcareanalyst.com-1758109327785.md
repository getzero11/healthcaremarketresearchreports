Urodynamics or Urodynamic testing is the assessment of lower urinary tract. It helps in explaining symptoms or dysfunction of the upper and lower urinary tracts. Urodynamics studies consist of a series of examinations that are useful for obtaining functional information regarding bladder filling, emptying and urine storage.

Urodynamics tests are generally performed in individuals suffering from various urological conditions such as urinary incontinence, stress incontinence and lower urinary tract symptoms. It also helps a healthcare provider to diagnose the cause and identify the nature of lower urinary tract disorder. Higher incidence of bladder dysfunction cases (urinary incontinence, stress incontinence, bladder neck obstruction, prostatitis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia, etc.), urology related disorders such as urinary incontinence, lower urinary tract obstruction and other urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the factors driving the growth of the global urodynamics equipment and disposables market.
