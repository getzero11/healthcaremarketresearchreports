Infusion pumps used to deliver fluids into a patient’s body in a controlled manner. These devices are capable of delivering fluids in large or small amounts to deliver nutrients or medications, such as insulin or other hormones, antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and pain relievers. These devices are used worldwide in healthcare facilities, as well as in the home.

They can deliver fluids in very small volumes and at precisely programmed rates. Infusion pumps have contributed to improvements in patient care, allowing for a greater level of control, accuracy, and precision in drug delivery, and thereby reducing medication errors. Using infusion pumps has become widely popular because of their capability to administer fluids that are practically impossible to control manually by medical professionals.

Technological advances in drug delivery systems and administration devices frequently enable improved control of drug administration. Such advances may offer numerous potential benefits to patients, including improved therapeutic outcomes in disease management, improved patient compliance with drug regimens, and greater efficiency and economy in disease therapy.

There are a number of commonly used specialty infusion pumps, including enteral, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and insulin infusion pumps. Enteral infusion pumps deliver liquid nutrients and medications to a patient’s digestive tract. PCA infusion pumps deliver pain medication. Insulin infusion pumps deliver insulin to patients with diabetes, and used in the home. Syringe infusion pumps are capable of delivering fluids from multiple reservoirs at multiple rates.

Major clinical applications of drug delivery systems include anesthesia delivery, antibiotic and antiviral therapy, bone marrow and organ transplant support therapy, cardiovascular disease management, chemotherapy, diabetes management, hydration therapy, nutritional support, pain management, and transfusion therapy. FDA is taking a more proactive and comprehensive approach to prevent safety problems by fostering the development of safer, more effective infusion pumps across the industry.
