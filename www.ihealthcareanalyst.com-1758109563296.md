## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Medical or diagnostic imaging is a part of biological imaging and incorporates radiology imaging technologies such as X-ray radiography devices, computed tomography (CT) scanners, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment, medical ultrasonography or ultrasound (2D, 3D, 4D), endoscopy, tactile imaging, thermography, medical photography and nuclear medicine functional imaging techniques as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

Nuclear imaging equipment such as PET and SPECT scanners have facilitated hard to achieve tasks in the field of medicine such as locating tumors in the brain and heart. Imaging devices such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT or CAT), and ultrasound have allowed further options for treatment guidance essentially with very low morbidity, which has lead to highly improved outcomes and quality of life for the patients.
