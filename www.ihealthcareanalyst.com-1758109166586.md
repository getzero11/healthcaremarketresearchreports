## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Neurovascular (neuroendovascular or neurointerventional) products are broadly divided along the lines of cerebral aneurysm, ischemic stroke, and general access / balloon. Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally and the fifth leading cause of death in the United States.

Each year, 33 million people worldwide suffer a stroke. Although hemorrhagic stroke is only 13% of total stroke (vs. 87% for ischemic stroke), it represents the majority (estimated 70-80%) of total neurovascular market.

Globally increasing incidence of stroke, coupled with rising geriatric population at the risk of neurovascular diseases is expected to boost the demand for neurointerventional products in the coming years.

Currently, the neurovascular market is in the middle of a growth phase due to new innovative devices backed by promising clinical data, which has led to successful treatment of new indications, increased adoption in the clinic, and more patients eligible for treatment.

Neurointerventional surgery has evolved rapidly over the last two-and-a-half decades. It is now the treatment of choice for many neurovascular conditions, and its techniques and indications are rapidly expanding.

The neuroendovascular device market, which has been growing rapidly, encompasses embolic devices (platinum coils and liquid embolic agents), neural thrombectomy devices (suction/aspiration devices, clot retrievers and snares), stent systems (carotid, cerebral and flow diversion), support devices (microcatheters and micro guidewires), and other devices.

The global neurovascular products market research report provides market size (Revenue $Million 2023 to 2033), market share analysis, growth trends and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).

The global market for neurovascular devices segmented by product \[embolization (embolic coils), embolization-enabling stents (flow-diversion stents and intrasaccular devices), mechanical thrombectomy devices, micro guidewires and micro catheters\], by application (cerebral aneurysm, cerebral artery stenosis, stroke, others), by end user (ambulatory surgical centers, hospitals, clinics) and geography.
