Organ transplantation involves replacing the damaged or diseased organ with a healthy organ by transferring of functional, intact organ from one individual to another. The organs can be donated by the living donors or even harvested from the organ donors that are brain-dead.

Advances in the technology and development within the medical sector has made it possible to transplant organs such as heart, kidney, liver, lungs, and various other [organs](https://www.ihealthcareanalyst.com/report/artificial-vital-organs-medical-bionics-market/). The major technical breakthroughs include developing techniques for vascular anastomoses, managing the immune response (chemical [immunosuppressants](https://www.ihealthcareanalyst.com/report/organ-transplant-immunosuppressant-drugs-market/)), and devising preservation [solutions](https://www.ihealthcareanalyst.com/report/organ-preservation-solutions-market/).

Organ transplants include single-organ transplants such as heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, and several multiple-organ transplants. Tissue transplants include bone marrow and corneal transplants. International variation in transplantation activities is recognized to be largely unrelated to the actual distribution of medical need and correlated instead with the resources available for healthcare provision.
