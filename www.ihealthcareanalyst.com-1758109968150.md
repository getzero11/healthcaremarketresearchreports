Neurovascular disorders, such as ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysm, can be devastating to quality of life or even fatal. Neurovascular medical devices can be used to treat these disorders, such as delivery of embolic coils and flow diversion stents to prevent aneurysm rupture and reduce patient risk, as well as the destruction or removal of cerebral blood clots using a neurothrombectomy device. Neurovascular catheters are used for interventions in the brain and intracranial spaces to perform neurovascular surgeries. Catheters used for these interventions are designed specifically, as neurovascular organs are sensitive and catheter failure or fault can result in vessel damage and perforation.

Endovascular treatment of intracranial vascular diseases, such as aneurysms, is often challenged by unfavorable vascular anatomy. The advent of new flexible intermediate catheters facilitated manual aspiration thrombectomy (MAT) for treating neurovascular ischemic diseases. While these catheters are somewhat flexible, most catheters were not designed specifically for aspiration. Trackability is an important property of catheters facilitating catheter advancement in highly tortuous cerebrovasculature.
