## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Computer-aided detection (CADe) or computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), is a technology designed to decrease observational oversights or false negative rates. Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, and Ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information, which the radiologist has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. It helps interpreting medical images in clinical practice that aid radiologists in detecting potential abnormalities on diagnostic radiology exams.  For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in the colon, and lung cancer. Computer-aided detection systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. CAD helps radiologists in detecting potentially diseased lesions or regions by using the clinical images generated through various imaging modalities such as X-Ray imaging, MRI, ultrasound imaging and computed tomography.
