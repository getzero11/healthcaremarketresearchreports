## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Cataract and glaucoma are the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Cataract accounts for approximately 16 million cases of blindness worldwide. In most countries of Africa and Asia, it accounts for approximately half of all blindness. Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness. Glaucoma can be treated with medication and alleviated by a small operation but is not curable.

An increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is known as major risk factor. Over the last decade several ophthalmic surgical products including novel minimally invasive surgical treatment options and devices for glaucoma have been developed. All these developments aim to cause as little trauma as possible to the eye, to safely, effectively, and sustainably reduce intraocular pressure, to produce reproducible results, and to be easy to adopt.

A wide range of ophthalmic surgery systems and micro instruments have applications in ophthalmic surgery in various hospitals and clinics. An intraocular lens (IOL) is a clear, artificial lens implant used to replace a cloudy natural lens in cataract surgery. IOLs also are used for a type of vision correction surgery called refractive lens exchange.

Currently, drainage devices that are implanted by means of micro-invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) present a promising approach for IOP lowering. (MIGS is gaining more and more interest and popularity. The possible reduction of the number of glaucoma medications, the ab interno approach without damaging the conjunctival tissue, and the probably safer procedures compared to incisional surgical methods.
