## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Patient monitoring can be performed by continuously measuring certain parameters by using a medical equipment for continuously measuring vital signs by a bedside monitor and/or by repeatedly performing medical tests such as blood glucose monitoring with a glucose meter. Multi-parameter patient monitoring enables monitoring of patient’s health and assists medical practitioners in deciding the treatment regimen as well as track the disease progression during treatment. Multi-parameter patient monitoring is effective in the management of post-acute care and chronic disease, especially in geriatric population which is prone to chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases. Monitoring of vital parameters most commonly include blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry and respiratory rate. Multiparameter equipment or monitors that simultaneously measure and display the relevant vital parameters are commonly integrated into the bedside monitors in critical care units, and the anesthetic machines in operating rooms.
