Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is a disinfection method that uses short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV-C) light to kill or inactivate microorganisms by destroying nucleic acids and disrupting their DNA, leaving them unable to perform vital cellular functions. UVGI generally refers to a UV wavelength of 253.7 nm (UV-C). Exposure to UV light at this wavelength is a practical and cost-effective method of inactivating airborne viruses, mycoplasma, bacteria, and fungi on clean surfaces.

The application of UVGI to disinfection has been used primarily in medical sanitation and sterile work facilities. UVGI has been used as a supplement to mechanical ventilation to inactivate airborne infectious agents to protect the health of building occupants. Upper-room UVGI installations are frequently used to provide ACH equivalent or effective (e-ACH) to that recommended by the CDC for AIIRs.

The most widely used application of UVGI is in the form of passive upper-room fixtures containing UVGI lamps that provide a horizontal layer of UV energy field above the occupied zone. These fixtures are designed to inactivate bacteria that enter the upper irradiated zone, and their efficacy is highly reliant on, among other factors, the airflow field conditions in the room. Critical factors that affect the efficacy of UVGI include temperature, RH, and lamp output.
