## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Prenatal and newborn genetic testing is referred to as the utilization of screening or diagnostic procedures for a fetus or a new born baby to detect chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, Patau syndrome and Edward syndrome. Prenatal testing and diagnosis have enabled the detection of certain genetic abnormalities in as early as 8 to 10 weeks of gestation and also helps to determine the sex of the fetus. Genetic testing is broadly segmented as newborn screening, diagnostic testing, carrier testing, prenatal testing, preimplantation testing, predictive and forensic testing. Higher maternal age and associated late pregnancies, public awareness about genetic disorders, and technological advancements are some of the factors contributing to the growth of global prenatal and newborn genetic testing market. Diagnostic methods are more effective, accurate and a preferred option for the detection of chromosome abnormalities as compared to the screening methods.

The global prenatal and newborn genetic testing market report provides market size ($Million 2023 to 2033), market share and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).
