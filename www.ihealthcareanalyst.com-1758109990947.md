## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Gene expression process includes conversion of the instructions present in the DNA into a functional product, such as a protein. This process is a tightly coordinated which allows a cell to respond to its changing environment. Gene expression is useful for identifying the molecular signature of a disease and for correlating a pharmacodynamic marker with the dose-dependent cellular responses to exposure of a drug.

Gene expression offers utility to guide drug discovery by illustrating engagement of the desired cellular pathways/networks, as well as avoidance of acting on the toxicological pathways.
