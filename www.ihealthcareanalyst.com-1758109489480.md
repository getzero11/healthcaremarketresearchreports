## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

There are many factors involved in an accurate allergy diagnosis and an effective treatment plan. Allergy patients are often sensitized to many allergens but are only clinically allergic to one or more specific substances. Allergy skin testing is the gold standard and is used along with the medical history to establish a diagnosis. Skin testing is minimally invasive, and when it is performed correctly it has good reproducibility, is easily quantified, and allows the evaluation of multiple allergens at one session.

Allergy blood tests may be carried out in certain specific situations, such as severe skin rashes, or if it is impossible to stop a medication that interferes with the interpretation of the skin test. Type I immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy testing is evaluated by measuring allergen-specific IgE, either through skin testing (in vivo) or with serological tests (in vitro).
