## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Robotic surgery (RS) is an evolution of minimally invasive surgery that combines medical science, robotics, and engineering. Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) is a sophisticated technique involving the use of specialized robotic platforms during surgical procedures to improve the precision movements in complex procedures and small anatomical spaces.

Robotic surgery requiring least incision has advanced over the years in a short period of time, benefitting both the patient and the surgeon. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has aided in surgical decision-making by improving the recognition of minute and complex anatomical structures.
