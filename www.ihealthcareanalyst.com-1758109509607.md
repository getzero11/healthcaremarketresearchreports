Immunotherapy drugs boosts the body’s natural defenses to fight various diseases. It uses substances made by the body or in a laboratory to improve or restore immune system function. Immunotherapy may work either by stopping or slowing the growth of diseased cells, stopping disease from spreading to other parts of the body, or helping the immune system work better at destroying affected cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are drugs, often made of antibodies that unleash an immune system attack on cancer cells. Three checkpoint inhibitors have received rapid approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cancer, including ipilimumab (Yervoy), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), and nivolumab (Opdivo). Cell-based immunotherapies are effective for some cancers. Therapies such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferons, imiquimod and cellular membrane fractions from bacteria are licensed for medical use. By targeting surface antigens expressed on tumor cells, monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated efficacy as cancer therapeutics. Antimicrobial immunotherapy, which includes vaccination, involves activating the immune system to respond to an infectious agent.
