The radio frequency identification (RFID) is a technology that uses radio waves to transfer data from an electronic tag, called RFID tag attached to an object, through a reader. RFID uses radio-frequency tags attached to people or objects to provide identification, tracking, security, and other functions that fall under the general heading of automatic identification and data capture (AIDC). Medical errors could be prevented by building a safer healthcare system. The RFID has been applied in hospital management for quickly retrieving patient information and monitoring patient locations in the hospital. Integrated RFID with hospital information systems (HIS) and electronic health records (EHRs) supported by clinical decision support systems (CDSS), facilitates processes and reduce medical, medication and diagnosis errors.
