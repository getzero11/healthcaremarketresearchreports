## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Esoteric tests require more sophisticated technology, equipment or materials, professional “hands-on” attention from highly skilled and technical personnel, and that may be performed less frequently than routine tests. Esoteric testing refers to specialized, complex, and less commonly used laboratory tests. These tests are typically performed in reference laboratories or specialized research institutions rather than general clinical labs. They are often used to diagnose rare disorders, detect specific tumor markers, or measure antibody levels related to certain conditions.
