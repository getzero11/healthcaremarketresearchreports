Metabolic bone diseases (MBD) include a diverse group of disorders of skeletal homeostasis. Metabolic bones disorders remain a major challenge for patients and physicians, despite the advances in medicine over the past few decades.

Although many of these are relatively common, these conditions can be difficult to diagnose and treat. Most commonly these disorders are caused by deficiencies of minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium or vitamin D leading to dramatic clinical disorders that are commonly reversible once the underlying defect has been treated. The MBD is often silent until the patients present with deformities or fractures.

Treatment devices for metabolic bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and osteomalacia, include drug/fluid delivery and infusion therapy devices and spinal motion preservation devices. Drug/fluid delivery and infusion therapy devices, such as injectors and patches, provide targeted delivery of medications and nutrients directly into the bloodstream or tissues, ensuring efficient absorption and rapid therapeutic effects. Spinal motion preservation devices, including artificial cervical and lumbar discs, are designed to replace damaged spinal discs, maintaining natural spinal movement and alleviating pain.
