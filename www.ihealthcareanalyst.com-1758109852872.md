Ventricular tachycardia is a heart rhythm disorder (arrhythmia) caused by abnormal electrical signals in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). This condition may also be called V-tach or VT. Ventricular tachycardia is caused by a disruption in the normal electrical impulses that control the rate of heart’s pumping action. Ventricular tachycardia can occur due to coronary heart disease, aortic stenosis, cardiomyopathy, electrolyte problems, or a heart attack.

Various diagnostic criteria have been developed to determine whether a wide complex tachycardia is ventricular tachycardia or a more benign rhythm. The best way to prevent ventricular tachycardia is to treat or eliminate risk factors that may lead to heart disease. Therapy may be directed either at terminating an episode of the abnormal heart rhythm or at reducing the risk of another VT episode.

Treatment involves restoring a normal heart rate by delivering a jolt of electricity to the heart. This may be done using a defibrillator or with a treatment called cardioversion. An implantable ICD is more effective than drug therapy for prevention of sudden cardiac death due to VT and ventricular fibrillation (VF), but may be constrained by cost issues, as well as patient co-morbidities and patient preference.

Cardiac resynchronization defibrillators have been demonstrated to reduce both mortality and heart failure in patients with significant ventricular dysfunction. Catheter ablation is a possible treatment for those with recurrent VT.
