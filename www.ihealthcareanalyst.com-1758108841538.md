## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Antihypertensive drugs are used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). Antihypertensive therapy seeks to prevent the complications of high blood pressure, such as stroke and myocardial infarction. There are many classes of antihypertensives, which lower blood pressure by different means. Among the most important and most widely used drugs are thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs), and beta blockers.

Patient age, associated clinical conditions and end-organ damage also play a part in determining dosage and type of medication administered. Although such drugs cannot give a radical cure, they can prevent heart failure, kidney failure and acute stroke induced by hypertension and delay the development of atherosclerosis by controlling the blood pressure.

The best available evidence favors the thiazide diuretics as the first-line treatment of choice for high blood pressure when drugs are necessary. Although clinical evidence shows calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-line treatments for most people (from both efficacy and cost points of view), an ACE inhibitor is recommended by NICE in the UK for those under 55 years old.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) comprises several leading brands such as Benicar (olmesartan medoxomil), Diovan (valsartan) and Micardis (telmisartan). The ‘others’ category includes endothelin receptor antagonists such as Tracleer, Opsumit (bosentan and macitentan) and Letairis (ambrisentan). All drug classes, except fixed-dose combinations (FDCs), represent sales of monotherapies.

The global antihypertensive drugs market segmentation is based on drug class (product/brand) – angiotensin II receptor blockers \[Olmesartan medoxomil (Benicar, Olmetec), Valsartan (Diovan, Byvalson), Telmisartan (Micardis), Irbesartan (Aprovel, Avapro), Candesartan cilexetil (Atacand, Blopress)\], angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors \[Captopril (Capoten), Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), Fosinopril (Monopril)\], beta-blockers \[Atenolol (Tenormin), Metoprolol Succinate (Lopressor, Metolar XR, Seloken, Toprol XL), Carvedilol (Coreg), Nadolol (Corgard), Propranolol (Inderal)\], calcium channel blockers \[Amlodipine (Norvasc), Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia)\], thiazide diuretics \[Hydrochlorothiazide (Aquazide, Apo-Hydro, Dyazide, BPZide), Chlorthalidone (Hygroton, Thalitone, Clorpres)\], fixed-dose combinations \[Olmesartan & Amlodipine (Azor), Valsartan & Amlodipine (Exforge), Losartan & Hydrochlorothiazide (Cozaar/Hyzaar), Amlodipine & Benazepril (Lotrel)\], and others and geography.
