## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

A wound dressing is used to help a wound heal and prevent further issues like infection or complications. Dressings are designed to be in direct contact with the wound, which is different from a bandage that holds the dressing in place. Wound dressings serve a variety of purposes depending on the type, severity and position of the wound. Aside from the major function of reducing the risk of infection, dressings are also important to help stop bleeding and start clotting so the wound can heal, absorb any excess blood, plasma or other fluids. The modern wound dressings include dry or impregnated gauze, plastic films, gels, foams, hydrocolloids, alginates, hydrogels, and polysaccharide pastes, granules and beads. They all provide different physical environments suited to different wounds. Wound dressings can also regulate the chemical environment of a wound, usually with the aim of preventing infection by the impregnation of topical antiseptic chemicals.
