Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs but TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine and brain. Not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. As a result, two TB- related conditions exist: latent TB infection(LTBI) and TB disease.

TB is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. A complete medical evaluation for tuberculosis (TB) must include a medical history, a physical examination, a chest X-ray and microbiological examination (of sputum or some other appropriate sample). It may also include a tuberculin skin test, other scans and X-rays, surgical biopsy.

In the year 2015–2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended GeneXpert MTB/RIF, a new TB diagnostic tests as well as approved Abbott Laboratories, Inc.’s lipoarabinomannan (LAM) test, a very affordable, simple, rapid, noninvasive, point-of-care (POC) rule-in test for people with HIV with very low CD4 counts. New versions of line-probe assays (LPAs) – Hain’s MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl and a product from Nipro (NTM+MDR-TB Detection Kit 2) have received WHO recommendations.

Improvements on nucleic acid amplification tests such as GeneXpert Omni and Ultra and Molbio’s TrueNAT are being validated. Further upstream, encouraging research into gene sets that can predict active TB disease and reliably distinguish it from latent TB and other infections may eventually underpin new blood tests. Incremental advances are being made to improve the detection of pediatric TB.
