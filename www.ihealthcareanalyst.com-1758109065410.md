## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Spinal implants are used to facilitate fusion, correct deformities, and stabilize and strengthen the spine in most spinal conditions, such as slippage of the spine (spondylolisthesis), chronic degenerative disc disease, traumatic fracture, and other forms of spinal instability including scoliosis. Spinal implants are specially designed and come in many shapes and sizes. Typically, these include rods, hooks, braided cable, plates, screws, and interbody cages. Fusion and rigid instrumentation have been currently the mainstay for the surgical treatment of degenerative diseases of the spine over the last 4 decades.

Spinal instrumentation utilizes surgical procedures to implant titanium, titanium-alloy, stainless steel, or non-metallic devices into the spine, which provides a permanent solution to spinal instability while facilitating the process of fusion. Posterior dynamic stabilization (PDS) indicates motion preservation devices that are aimed for surgical treatment of activity related mechanical low back (lumbar) disorders or pain. Most of these devices have predominately been used throughout Europe with limited use in the United States.

Spinal compression fractures may be treated with surgery. Vertebral augmentation implant, kyphoplasty, and vertebroplasty are three minimally invasive treatments that use bone cement for thoracic and lumbar spinal compression fractures. Motion preservation surgery uses devices to preserve the spine motion by replicating normal or near normal bio-mechanics, that replicate these functions.

The global spinal implants market segmentation is based on product \[artificial cervical and lumbar discs {artificial cervical discs, artificial lumbar discs, dynamic stabilization devices, interspinous process decompression devices, pedicle screw-based dynamic stabilization devices), spinal fusion instrumentation (cervical fusion – anterior cervical fusion, posterior cervical fusion, cervical pedicle screw systems, interbody cervical fusion, thoracic and lumbar fusion, posterior spinal fixation devices), vertebral compression fracture treatments (vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, percutaneous vertebral augmentation systems), other motion preserving devices (annulus repair, disc nucleus replacement technologies)\].
