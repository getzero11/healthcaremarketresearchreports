## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

A reliable, rapid, and effective bioanalytical method is essential for the determination of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicokinetic parameters that inform the safety and efficacy profile of investigational drugs. The overall goal of bioanalytical method development is to elucidate the procedure and operating conditions under which a method can sufficiently extract, qualify, and/or quantify the analyte(s) of interest and/or their metabolites for the intended purpose. Given the difference in the physicochemical properties of large molecule drugs, different strategies need to be adopted for the development of an effective and efficient bioanalytical method.
