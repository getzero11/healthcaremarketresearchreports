Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is the use of algorithms and software to approximate human cognition in the analysis of complex medical data. The primary aim of health-related AI applications is to analyze relationships between prevention or treatment techniques and patient outcomes. AI programs have been developed and applied to practices such as diagnosis processes, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care. Medical institutions such as The Mayo Clinic, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, and National Health Service have developed AI algorithms for their departments. Large technology companies such as IBM and Google, and startups such as Welltok and Ayasdi have also developed AI algorithms for healthcare.

Recently launched, Google Deepmind Health project mines medical records to provide better and faster health services, as well as process hundreds of thousands of medical information within minutes. Google is working with the Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to improve eye treatment. IBM Watson launched WatsonPaths in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. WatsonPaths consisting two cognitive computing technologies that helps physicians make more informed and accurate decisions faster and to cull new insights from electronic medical records (EMR). Careskore, a cloud-based predictive analytics platform for health systems and physician organizations predicts through its Zeus algorithm in real time, based on combination of clinical, labs, demographic and behavioral data on patients. Zephyr Health helps life science companies improve research and reduce the time it takes to bring their therapies to market. Oncora Medical launched its Precision Radiation Oncology platform to help patients receive personalized treatments. Sentrian helps to eliminate all preventable hospital admissions through remote patient monitoring. CloudMedX utilizes evidence-based algorithms, machine learning and natural language processing to generate real-time clinical insights at all points of care to improve patient outcomes. Butterfly Network is creating a new handheld medical imaging device that can make both MRI and ultrasounds significantly cheaper and more efficient.
