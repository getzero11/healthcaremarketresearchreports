## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Multiple myeloma (MM) or plasma cell myeloma, is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell normally responsible for producing antibodies. Risk factors include obesity, radiation exposure, family history, and certain chemicals.

The global burden of multiple myeloma has increased uniformly in the last 30 years, but the incidence of myeloma is highly variable among different countries. The estimated world-wide 5-year prevalence is approximately 230,000 patients.

According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/)’s estimates for multiple myeloma about 32,110 new cases were diagnosed in United States for 2019.  It is not a common cancer but is the second most common blood cancer after non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States.

MM is a disease of the older population and its incidence in the African American population is twice that of the European American population. Stem-cell transplant treatment is routinely available in high-income countries, but availability was lacking in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the Middle East. Approval for effective drugs and stem cell transplantation options are also lacking in many low-income countries.

Improvements in the treatment of MM in the past couple of decades, beginning with the use of autologous stem cell transplantation followed by availability of novel treatments such as immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of novel therapies with meaningful efficacy, tempo of drug development, and the science in underlying disparities in patients with MM.  The recent introduction of novel therapies has been paralleled by advancements in the monitoring of MM, namely, by the availability exquisitely sensitive techniques in detecting minimal residual disease.
