## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Interventional cardiology devices are minimally invasive devices used in the detection and treatment of coronary artery disease. Interventional cardiology involves various non-surgical procedures for treating cardiovascular disease by using drug-eluting stents, bare-metal stents, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and cutting balloon catheters.

Interventional cardiology is a minimally invasive catheter-based technology that enables treatment of coronary artery disease (coronary blockages or narrowing of the coronary artery restricting normal blood flow). Rising incidences of coronary artery disease, increasing lifestyle disorders such as obesity and growing disposable income are primarily leading to increase in the number of percutaneous interventions.
