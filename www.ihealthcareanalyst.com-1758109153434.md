## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women, impacting 2.1 million women each year. World Health Organization ([WHO](https://www.who.int/cancer/prevention/diagnosis-screening/breast-cancer/en/)) estimated that 627,000 women died from breast cancer in 2018, that is approximately 15% of all cancer deaths among women. According to [World Cancer Research Fund](https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-trends/breast-cancer-statistics), there were over 2 million new cases in 2018 worldwide, and Belgium had the highest rate of breast cancer in women, followed by Luxembourg and Netherlands.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women after skin cancer. According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures-2017-2018.pdf), in the U.S. in 2018, there will be an estimated 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in women and 2,550 cases diagnosed in men.

While breast cancer rates are higher among women in more developed regions, rates are increasing in nearly every region globally. Limited resource settings with weak health systems, where most women are diagnosed in late stages should prioritize early diagnosis programmes based on awareness of early signs and symptoms and prompt referral to diagnosis and treatment. In limited resource settings with weak health systems, mammography is not cost-effective, and early detection should focus on reducing stage at diagnosis through improved awareness.

In order to improve breast cancer outcomes and survival, early detection is critical. There are two early detection strategies for breast cancer: early diagnosis and screening. Various methods have been evaluated as breast cancer screening tools, including mammography, clinical breast exam and breast self-exam. Mammography uses low-energy X-rays to identify abnormalities in the breast. It has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality by approximately 20% in high-resource settings.
