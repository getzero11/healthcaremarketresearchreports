Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) is defined as the loss of more than 500 ml or 1000 ml of blood within the first 24 hours following childbirth. It is generally caused by four major conditions- tone (uterine atony), trauma, tissue (retained placenta), Thrombin (coagulopathy). The treatment devices have been available in the market for more than two decades.

Women are at the highest risk of severe complications or maternal death during the first 24 hours postpartum and the first week after childbirth. Uterine balloon tamponades are recommended in case of refractory bleeding or if uterotonics are inaccessible, while non-pneumatic anti-shock garments and external aortic compression are primarily recommended as temporizing measures until the patient has been transferred to an advanced healthcare setting.
