## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The management of patients with rhythm problems has been revolutionized, primarily through the great advances in the engineering, manufacturing, and implantation techniques of cardiac rhythm management devices. Cardiac rhythm management (CRM) includes implantable devices, leads and accessories as well as external devices to treat and manage arrhythmia-related diseases. Specifically designed implantable devices for either too slow a heart rhythm (pacemakers) or too fast a rhythm (cardioverter defibrillators) help patients benefit as their overall health status can be improved. The CRM devices addresses heart disease and heart rhythm disorders through such systems as: pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices, implantable cardiac monitors and other novel implantable devices. The cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device restores interventricular and intraventricular dyssynchrony in patients with heart failure (HF). The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) manages ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF) and saves lives primarily through the use of high-energy shocks, while the cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED), the electronic pacemaker, maintains cardiac contraction during bradycardia.

The global implantable cardiac rhythm management devices market segmentation is based on device type (cardiac resynchronization therapy systems – CRT defibrillators, CRT pacemakers; implantable cardioverter defibrillators systems; implantable pacemaker systems).
