## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Epigenetics regulates gene expression in a reversible manner by chemically modifying DNA and histone proteins, which prevent permanent mutations or alterations within the genes or genome itself. Epigenetics is a study of change in the gene expression without any change in gene sequence. Epigenetic changes beyond a normal expression pattern can cause a variety of diseases.

Epigenetic therapy involves use of drugs or other epigenome-influencing techniques to treat medical conditions including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and mental illnesses. The global epigenetics drugs market growth mainly is driven by factors such as rising incidence of cancer, advancements in screening tools and huge sum invested in research and development activities.

The impact of DNMT inhibitors is highly significant for inhibiting the cell cycle growth, and these inhibitors by their mechanism of action account for the major share of the global epigenetics drugs market.

The global epigenetic epigenetic drugs and diagnostics market report estimates the market size ($million 2023 to 2033) for key market segmented by diagnostic technology (ChIP technology, DNA methylation), and their mechanism \[DNMT inhibitors – azacitidine (vidaza) and decitabine (dacogen); and HDAC inhibitors or HDIs – belinostat (Beleodaq), chidamide (Epidaza), panobinostat (Farydak), romidepsin (istodax), vorinostat (zolinza)\], and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).

Some of the promising pipeline drugs include ACY‑1215, Abexinostat, Entinostat, Mocetinostat, Resminostat, Rocilinostat, RVX-208, SGI 110, SRT2104, and Valproic acid.
