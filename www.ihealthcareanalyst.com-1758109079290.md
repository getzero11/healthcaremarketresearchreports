## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (G/GEJAC) represents the majority of gastric cancer cases worldwide. The disease accounts for 1% of cancers diagnosed in the United States, and more often in other parts of the world. Gastroesophageal cancer is anatomically subdivided into tumors of the stomach (gastric), oesophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). The gastroesophageal cancer market is largely untapped and thus represents a lucrative opportunity for drug manufacturers.

Therapeutic options for gastroesophageal cancer are limited, where the major treatments are chemotherapy-based. Platinum-based and fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy is the first-line of chemotherapy-based treatment for gastroesophageal cancer, irrespective of tumor site, stage of disease and histology. Whereas, targeted therapies such as HER2 and angiogenesis inhibitors have been approved and are being administered in combination with chemotherapy drugs since 2010 and 2014, respectively.

The drug market for gastroesophageal cancer is likely to increase over the forecast period, largely because of the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. The market growth over the forecast period will be mainly driven by the approval and uptake of premium-priced products, such as Eli Lilly’s Cyramza (ramucirumab) and PD-1-targeting mAbs, Merck & Co.’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and BMS’ Opdivo (nivolumab). Numerous targeted therapies are also in late-stage development. Therapies in phase III development for gastroesophageal cancer include Andecaliximab, Avelumab (Bavencio), IMAB362, Ipilimumab (Yervoy), Napabucasin, Nimotuzumab, Pamiparib, Regorafenib (Stivarga), Rivoceranib (Apatinib), S-1 and folinic acid (TAS-118), S588410, Tislelizumab, Trifluridine and tipiracil (Lonsurf).

The global gastroesophageal cancer drugs market segmentation is based on drug class (angiogenesis inhibitors, CTLA4 inhibitors, cytotoxic agents, HER2 inhibitors, MMP9 inhibitors, PD1 inhibitors, PDL1 inhibitors).
