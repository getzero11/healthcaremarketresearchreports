## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of neurological disability among young adults. Although the precise causes of MS remain unknown, the disease is characterized by an autoimmune reaction against myelin, the fatty insulation that surrounds nerve cells. MS is highly heterogeneous but has three main subtypes: relapsing forms of MS (RFMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS) and progressive relapsing MS (PRMS). Worldwide, MS affects ~2.3 million people, where the majority of patients (~85%) have RFMS, 10% have PPMS, and 5% have PRMS.

Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing MS symptoms. Treatment for MS depends on the specific symptoms and difficulties the person has. It may include treating relapses of MS symptoms (with steroid medication), treating specific MS symptoms, and treatment to reduce the number of relapses (disease-modifying therapies).

Treatment options for relapsing-remitting MS include Beta interferons are among the most commonly prescribed medications to treat MS and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) may help block your immune system’s attack on myelin. Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) can reduce relapses. Fingolimod (Gilenya) and Teriflunomide (Aubagio) oral medications reduces relapse rate.

Natalizumab (Tysabri) blocks the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from your bloodstream to your brain and spinal cord. Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) drug helps reduce relapses of MS by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. In 2016, all of the available disease-modifying treatments for MS were approved for relapsing forms of the disease, and no treatment options existed for PPMS.
