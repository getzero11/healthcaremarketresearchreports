## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Needle-free injection systems are novel ways to introduce various medicines into patients without piercing the skin with a conventional needle. A needle-free delivery device can deliver the drug either actively or passively is a rational alternative. Needle free drug delivery technology provides effective drug delivery for wide range of drugs; it is bio-equivalent to syringe and needle and results in less pain.

In the case of delivering the drug actively, a driving force is necessary for the transport of drug across the skin, which may be accomplished using jet injectors, electroporation, iontophoresis, ultrasound, powder injection, and tape stripping. Different delivery systems have been developed to deliver vaccine to the epidermal layer of skin.
