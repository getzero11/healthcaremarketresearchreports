Fluoroscopy is an imaging technique that uses X-rays to obtain real-time moving images of the interior of an object, where the fluoroscope allows imaging of internal structure and function of a patient. It is used for both diagnosis and therapy and occurs in general radiology, interventional radiology, and image-guided surgery.

Mobile c-arms have radiographic capabilities, though they are used primarily for fluoroscopic imaging during surgical, orthopedic, critical care, and emergency care procedures. Fluoroscopy and Mobile C-arms are used in interventional radiology procedures and provide live images to guide the operator for carrying out the procedures effectively.

Factors such as aging population, rising preference for minimally invasive procedures and awareness about different disease conditions will contribute to the growth of the global fluoroscopy and mobile C-arms market.
