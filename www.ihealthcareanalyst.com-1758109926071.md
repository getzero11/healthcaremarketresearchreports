## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare progressive neurological disorder characterized by movement disorders, cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and psychiatric disturbances. Current treatment is entirely dependent on symptomatic therapies and includes a cocktail of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antiepileptics to control patients’ cognitive, behavioral, and neurological symptoms.

The HD therapeutics market is considerably sparse, and there are only two currently FDA-approved treatments for the symptomatic management of chorea associated with HD, Bausch’s Xenazine (tetrabenazine) and Teva’s Austedo. A large number of symptomatic treatments are currently used off-label for HD.
