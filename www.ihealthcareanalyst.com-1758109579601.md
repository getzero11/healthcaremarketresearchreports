## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Immunosuppressant drugs or anti-rejection drugs are a class of drugs that suppress or reduce the strength of the body’s immune system. There are 2 types of immunosuppressants: Induction drugs: Powerful antirejection medicine used at the time of transplant and Maintenance drugs: antirejection medications used for the long term. Organ transplant immunosuppressant drugs are used by patients who are undergoing or have undergone an organ transplant for kidney, liver, heart, etc. due to organ dysfunction caused due to cancer, severe injuries to the organ, metabolic disorders such as renal failure and/or genetic disorders.

Increasing number of organ transplantations globally and its demand for advanced immunosuppressant drugs for improved organ tolerance are the key factors driving the growth of the global organ transplant immunosuppressant drugs market. There are usually four classes of maintenance drugs: calcineurin inhibitors: tacrolimus and cyclosporine, antiproliferative agents: mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolate sodium and azathioprine, mTOR inhibitor: sirolimus, and steroids: prednisone.
