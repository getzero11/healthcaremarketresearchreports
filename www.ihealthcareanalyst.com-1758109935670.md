## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of over 70 rare inherited metabolic disorders that are caused for the most part by enzyme deficiencies within the lysosome resulting in accumulation of undegraded substrate. Examples of LSDs include the Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Pompe disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, mucolipidoses, oligosaccharidoses, the Niemann-Pick disorders, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses.

Several LSDs can be treated with approved, disease-specific therapies that are mostly based on enzyme replacement. However, small-molecule therapies, including substrate reduction and chaperone therapies, have also been developed and are approved for some LSDs, whereas gene therapy and genome editing are at advanced preclinical stages and, for a few disorders, have already progressed to the clinic. The main treatment methods include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy (SRT), use of molecular chaperones, bone marrow transplantation, and gene therapy.
