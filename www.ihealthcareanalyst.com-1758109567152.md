## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Capnography equipment are used for monitoring the concentration or partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the respiratory gases during anesthesia and intensive care. It is also being used by EMS personnel to aid in their assessment and treatment of patients in the prehospital environment.

Capnography provides information about CO2 production, pulmonary (lung) perfusion, alveolar ventilation, respiratory patterns, and elimination of CO2 from the anesthesia breathing circuit and ventilator. It is mainly used during sedation procedures, and for constant monitoring in intensive care units and the technology is also used for diagnosis of respiratory diseases. Capnography machines generate information about CO2 production, alveolar ventilation, pulmonary perfusion, respiratory patterns, and elimination of CO2 from the ventilator and anesthesia breathing circuit.
