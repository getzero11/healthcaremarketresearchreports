## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Genomic engineering refers to the strategies and techniques implemented for the modification of target genetic information of any living organism. The genomic engineering market is growing rapidly due to large number of applications in areas such as gene mutations, therapeutics, and agricultural biotechnology.

Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) and Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) were the first and second generation of genome editing tools used in plant during 2005 and 2011, respectively. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is regarded as the most prevalent and third-generation genome editing tool first used in plant genes in 2013. Currently, CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) is the simplest, most versatile and precise method of genetic manipulation that has been demonstrated to work in a programmable manner.

Compared to CRISPR, ZFN and TALEN technologies are less precise and require complex proteins to be engineered requiring high costs to successfully use the systems. Today, advances in gene-editing tool CRISPR is changing the ways new medical treatments are developed. Its applications in genome-wide studies has enabled large-scale screening for drug targets and facilitated the generation of engineered animal models. It has created a fertile environment for mass-scale manufacturing of cost-effective products ranging from basic research to translational medicine. For medical research and applications, animal models and human cell lines are generated to emulate human diseases.
