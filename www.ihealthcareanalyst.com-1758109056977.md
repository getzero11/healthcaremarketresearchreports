## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin condition. It is a multifaceted, chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease that is commonly associated with other atopic manifestations such as food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. It affects people of all ages but more common among infants and children. Risk factors for atopic dermatitis are mainly categorized as modifiable and non-modifiable. Modifiable risk factors include inhalant and food allergens; however, non-modifiable risk factors include genetics or heritability.

AD therapy mainstay includes use of emollients, topical/oral corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and for severe AD – phototherapy and systemic immunomodulators. Standard treatments for AD attempt to reduce inflammation and pruritus with combinations of emollients, topical corticosteroids, and topical immunomodulators. Additionally, systemic immunomodulators, and in some cases UV phototherapy, are used to treat AD. Treatment with topical therapies and anti-inflammatory agents is often successful; however, more-effective therapies for treatment-refractory AD represent an area of tremendous unmet need.

When topical treatments fail, systemic therapies are required. Systemic anti-inflammatory therapy is appropriate for severe AD patients; about 10% of adult patients receive systemic anti-inflammatory therapy at some point during the course of their disease, while in children it is rarely employed. Artificial UV radiation is frequently used as a second-line treatment for moderate-to-severe AD in adults. Non-biologic systemic drugs used for adult AD include corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate, which exert their immunosuppressive effects by reducing the disease inflammatory cell numbers and proinflammatory cytokines expression.
