Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) are a diverse family of antibodies or antibody constructs that recognize two epitopes or antigens. All four marketed bispecific drugs target different biology, for example, T cell redirection (blinatumomab), cofactor mimicking by bringing together two coagulation factors (emicizumab) and dual targeting (amivantamab and faricimab).

Bispecific antibodies are also obligate bsAbs with display activities that are not observed with the parental molecules. Dual targeting may not always classify as obligate; however, each target may require careful affinity optimization for biological activity and such selectivity or specificity may not be achieved by a mere combination of parental antibodies.

Cancer immunotherapy has made remarkable progress in the past decade. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have acquired much attention as the next generation strategy of antibody-target cancer immunotherapy, which overwhelmingly focus on T cell recruitment and dual receptors blockade.

These bsAbs show great variability in design and mechanism of action. The various designs are often linked to the mechanisms of actions. The majority of bsAbs engage immune cells to destroy tumor cells. However, some bsAbs are also used to deliver payloads to tumors or to block tumor signaling pathways.
