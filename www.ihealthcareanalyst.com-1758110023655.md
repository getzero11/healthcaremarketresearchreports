## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Scars represent the visible sequelae of trauma, injury, burn, or surgery. They may induce distress in the patient because of their aesthetically unpleasant appearance, especially if they are excessively raised, depressed, wide, or erythematous. They may also cause the patient symptoms of pain, tightness, and pruritus. Numerous products are marketed for scar prevention or improvement.

There is an increasing number of over-the-counter topical products that are said to prevent pathologic scar formation and improve scar cosmesis. The advent and development of laser technology represents perhaps the most promising treatment modality for the cosmetic and functional improvement of cutaneous scars.
