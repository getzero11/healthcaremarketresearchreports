## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Liver cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most dominant form of liver cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of liver cancer cases. In 2016, there were 39,230 new cases and 27,170 deaths from liver cancer in the US.

It occurs mainly due to hepatitis C infection, and to a lesser extent hepatitis B and alcohol. While surgical resection and liver transplantation are potentially curative therapies for early-stage HCC, the majority of diagnoses take place at a disease stage that is too advanced for these treatments.

Development of new treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma has been challenging, and only three chemotherapy drugs and one biologic drug have been approved. There are serious challenges which face the development of new therapies for this indication, including having to conduct trials in patients more prone to toxicity problems, and producing a higher standard of care than Nexavar in the first-line setting.

A total of four oral multi-kinase inhibitors (MKIs) have been approved for hepatocellular carcinoma. Nexavar, Stivarga, Lenvima and Cabometyx are the approved as chemotherapy drugs for HCC treatment in the US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Japan and China.

In 2007, Bayer HealthCare/Amgen/Onyx’s Nexavar was approved as a first-line treatment for developed markets. In 2017, second MKI, Bayer HealthCare’s regorafenib (Stivarga; Bayer) was approved as a second-line treatment by the FDA. Third MKI, lenvatinib (Lenvima; Eisai and Merck & Co.) was approved as a first-line treatment in Japan, the US and Europe in 2018. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) inhibitor, nivolumab Opdivo (United States only) was the only biologic approved in 2017, as second-line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma.

The pipeline for hepatocellular carcinoma is dominated by angiogenesis inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors that are being developed as combination therapies. Targeted therapies for second-line treatment constitute the largest proportion of the HCC pipeline. New immuno-oncology products and combination therapies are anticipated to change the landscape over the next years. New drug launches in both the first- and second-line settings is likely to expand the previously stagnant HCC market.

Combination regimens, specifically those including checkpoint inhibitors, will be introduced in the first line setting to target major unmet needs, including overcoming tumor resistance, improving progression free survival, and maintaining quality of life. Phase III pipeline of drugs include atezolizumab (Tecentriq), bevacizumab (Avastin), Durvalumab (Imfinzi), ramucirumab (Cyramza), tislelizumab, and tremelimumab.
