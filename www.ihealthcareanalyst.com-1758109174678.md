## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Cannabis, also known as marijuana, recently have its medicinal properties been recognized and gained attention in research and development. In recent years, marijuana has been growing in public awareness in many countries around the world for its medical purposes. This has subsequently led to several jurisdictions either decriminalizing cannabis, or legalizing it for medical purposes with some countries moving towards full legalization.

With the growing acceptance of cannabis in public awareness, it led to the creation of two separate industries as medical cannabis industry, and recreational cannabis industry. The two industries producing products with different strains and delivery mechanisms to meet consumer demand and preferences.
