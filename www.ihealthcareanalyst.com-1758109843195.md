## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Spinal instrumentation, also known as spinal implants, devices or hardware, uses surgical procedures to implant titanium, titanium-alloy, stainless steel, or non-metallic devices into the spine. Instrumentation provides a permanent solution to spinal instability. There are many different types, shapes and sizes of medical implants designed specifically to treat spinal disorders in people of all ages.

Instrumentation is used during spinal fusion because it helps maintain spinal stability while facilitating the process of bone fusion. These procedures are used to restore stability to the spine, treat spinal deformity (such as scoliosis), and bridge space created by the removal of a spinal element (such as intervertebral disc) during a spinal decompression procedure.

There are three primary types of spine surgery instrumentation: pedicle screws and anterior interbody cages, and posterior lumbar cages. Pedicle screws provide a means of gripping onto a vertebral segment and limiting its motion.

Anterior interbody cages are devices inserted into the lumbar disc space through an anterior (from the front) approach. They can be made of allograft bone, titanium, or carbon/PEEK (radiolucent cages). Posterior lumbar cages are also inserted into the lumbar disc space, but are modified to be inserted through a posterior approach. They can be made out of the same materials as an anterior cage.

Examples of spinal implants include plates, pedicle screws, expandable cages, artificial discs, rods, connectors interspinous stabilization devices, vertebral body tethering, Sacroiliac (SI) joint fixation devices, and interbody devices (cage-like structures that support bones).
