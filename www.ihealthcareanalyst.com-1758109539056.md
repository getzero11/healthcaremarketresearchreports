## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The spinal cord injuries (SCI) results in either temporary or permanent change in the cord’s normal motor, sensory, or autonomic function. Inventive medical devices such as modern wheelchairs, computer adaptations, electronic aids, functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems and robotic gait training can help spinal trauma patients become more independent and mobile.

A range of passive and active devices are under development or are already in clinical use to partially restore function after spinal cord injury. Prosthetic devices to promote host tissue regeneration and plasticity and reconnection are under development, comprising bioengineered bridging materials free of cells. Alternatively, artificial electrical stimulation and robotic bridges may be used.

A range of neuroprostheses interfacing either with CNS or peripheral nervous system both above and below the lesion are under investigation and are at different stages of development or translation to the clinic. In addition, there are orthotic and robotic devices which are being developed and tested in the laboratory and clinic that can provide mechanical assistance, training or substitution after spinal cord injuries.
