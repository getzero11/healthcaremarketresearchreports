Monoclonal antibody therapy is a form of immunotherapy that uses monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to bind monospecifically to certain cells or proteins. This may then stimulate the patient’s immune system to attack those cells. It is possible to create a mAb specific to almost any extracellular/ cell surface target. Research and development is underway to create antibodies for diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Ebola and different types of cancers). Chimeric antibodies are composed of murine variable regions fused onto human constant regions. Humanized antibodies are produced by grafting murine hypervariable regions on amino acid domains into human antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies are produced using transgenic mice or phage display libraries by transferring human immunoglobulin genes into the murine genome and vaccinating the transgenic mouse against the desired antigen, leading to the production of appropriate monoclonal antibodies. Murine antibodies have short half-life in vivo, limited penetration into tumor sites and inadequately recruit host effector functions.

The global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market segmentation is based on source type (chimeric and humanized, human, murine, others), therapy type (antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy, antibody-drug conjugates, radioimmunotherapy), application (autoimmune diseases, cancer, hematological diseases, infection, ophthalmological diseases, others), and end user (hospitals, private clinics, research institutes).
