RFID blood management systems aim at ensuring the quality of the blood and increasing the efficiency of operation management. In this system, the fingerprint sensor is adopted to enable the process of identifying blood donor more reliable and credible and RFID tag is used to make the management more convenient. In addition, GPRS is applied in this system so that real-time data can be transmitted between the bloodmobile and blood center through wireless Internet. The process, often involves large amounts of data, including information on blood donors, blood type, blood collection time, location, handling, etc. In general, blood management has brought some difficulties, coupled with blood is a very perishable substance, if the environmental conditions are not suitable, the quality of the blood that is destroyed, so the blood in storage and transit, quality real-time monitoring is also very crucial. RFID and sensor technology is able to effectively manage of the emerging technology of blood. RFID technology can provide its own unique identity each bag of blood, and its corresponding information stored, the information with back-end database connectivity, so the blood both in blood point, or points in the mobilization of blood banks, hospital, or at the point of use, can be monitored throughout the RFID system, the blood in the information each mobilization points can always be tracked out.  RFID technology enables analysis of large quantities of data in real-time acquisition, transfer, check and update to speed up the identification of blood out of storage, and also avoids the artificial check errors. RFID and contactless identification feature can also ensure that blood is not contaminated by identifying and detecting and reducing the possibility of blood contamination. The RFID technology in hospital blood management includes blood bags equipped with an RFID chip, containing only one security database information associated with the identifier of the chip. It can be verified by a handheld reader or computer bags of information related to patient blood RFID wristbands information matches, to ensure that patients receive blood match.
