## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Biomaterial implants and medical devices have been utilized extensively in medical treatment with the development of modern medicine. There has been an enormous growth in the application of coatings onto medical devices in the last few years.

Various coatings are offered for medical devices, including lubricious, hydrophilic, hydrophobic, non-thrombogenic (anti-clotting), antimicrobial, and several classes of orthopedic industry metal treatments and ceramic coatings. Some of the examples of these coatings range from hydroxyapetite, which enhance cell attachment onto orthopedic implants, to antimicrobial silver coatings on catheters, drug eluting coatings on stents and blood compatible coatings such as heparin.

Antimicrobial coating strategies have been reported to effectively inhibit bacterial adhesion and proliferation on implant surface, extending their lifespan. Anti-thrombogenic coatings are used for blood-contacting medical devices, such as vascular grafts, stents, heart valves, and catheters, are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases. Drug-eluting coatings are used in device drug combination products (DDCP) such as, drug-eluting stents, drug-coated balloons, and drug delivery coatings for non-vascular implants. Hydrophilic coatings are much thinner than swelling lubricious hydrogel coatings. The company also has several different technologies for non-thrombogenic heparin coatings.

In addition, the combination coatings, where multiple coatings on the same surface or different coatings on different parts of the same device offer medical devices a number of benefits.
