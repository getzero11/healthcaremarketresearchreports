## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Blood pressure monitoring is one of the vital signs along with respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. There are two main types of blood pressure (BP) monitors: aneroid (mercury) and digital, whereas there are three different types of digital blood pressure monitors in the market: arm-type, wrist-type and finger-type.

Blood pressure can be defined as a measure of force that is exerted upon the walls of blood vessels. The exact cause of high blood pressure is unknown but it develops with changing lifestyle and growing age. Blood pressure monitors are widely used by physicians in clinics, hospitals and even by patients themselves at home for self-monitoring.

Hypertension is one of the leading cause of heart disease and strokes globally. Certain disease conditions such as coronary heart diseases and renal failure requires continuous high blood pressure monitoring.
