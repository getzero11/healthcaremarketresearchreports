## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in men worldwide. Prostate cancer is the biggest killer of men in the developed world. If caught early enough, i.e. pre-metastatic, the best treatment is still surgery, but the procedure is fraught. About 57% of patients are diagnosed with the disease after the age of 65 years.

The historic standard treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), docetaxel, provides a median overall survival improvement. Traditionally, chemotherapy was the mainstay of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Docetaxel was the primary agent because it improved overall survival (OS), but its unfavorable toxicity profile has since relegated it to later-line therapy.

Since 2010, multiple hormone therapies have been approved and have become favored options for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Several new products came to market in recent years. Two anti-androgen products, abiraterone (Zytiga) and enzalutamide (Xtandi), approved in 2011 and 2012, respectively, represented major advances. However, market access is also limited by their expensive pricing patterns (The average wholesale price for Zytiga is US$11,275, and enzalutamide costs US$89,000 a year in the United States). In 2018, Erleada (Apalutamide) and Nubeqa (Darolutamide) were approved by US-FDA as anti-androgen therapy or androgen receptor inhibitors (ARIs).

In 2011, sipuleucel‑T (Provenge), an autologous dendritic cell-based immunotherapy, was approved for first-line usage in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic CRPC, making it the first therapeutic cancer vaccine to be approved in the United States. However, it has underperformed in terms of early sales, with likely barriers being lingering doubts about the quality of its key clinical trial, its $93,000 annual cost and its complex administration process, balanced against a modest efficacy benefit.

Approved in 2013, the radioactive calcium mimetic radium‑223 dichloride (Xofigo), which specifically targets bone metastases (present in 80–90% of patients with metastatic CRPC), is the newest treatment for CRPC. Cabazitaxel and sipuleucel‑T remain viable options for certain patients, although their respective market shares are expected to remain small relative to abiraterone, enzalutamide and docetaxel.

Other recent approvals are the receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand inhibitor denosumab (Xgeva), which targets bone metastases by increasing bone growth, and the taxane cabazitaxel (Jevtana; Sanofi); both have had a limited impact on this indication owing to modest efficacy profiles.

The pipeline is filled with exciting therapies designed with various mechanisms of action. The pipeline for prostate cancer is large and diverse that includes next-generation hormonal therapies \[JNJ-56021927 (Johnson & Johnson), ODM-201 (Bayer/Orion), Galeterone (Tokai Pharmaceuticals)\], immunotherapy \[CVAC/PCa (SOTIO), Prostvac (Bavarian Nordic), ProstAtak (Advantagene)\], and targeted therapy \[masitinib (AB Science)\]. In addition to small molecules, autologous cell vaccination, viral-based vaccines and monoclonal antibodies are being developed. These include rilimogene galvacirepvec (Prostvac; Bavarian Nordic) for hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer and AdV‑tk + valacyclovir (Prostatak; Advantagene) in the localized setting.

Owing to their high level of specificity for targets such as growth factor receptors and tumor antigens, there are several monoclonal antibodies in the pipeline for CRPC. The level of competition in this market is expected to increase, although novel products for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer are unlikely to directly compete with products that are approved for CRPC, and vice versa. However, the approvals of drugs such as viral-vector based vaccines in earlier disease settings are also expected to make a growing contribution, particularly towards the end of the decade. Cancer vaccines are expected to become a more prominent drug class.

The global prostate cancer treatment market segmentation is based on product (drug class/brand) – hormonal androgen deprivation therapy / hormonal agents \[Casodex (Bicalutamide), Eligard (leuprolide), Lupron (leuprolide acetate), Triptorelin (decapeptyl or gonapeptyl), Zoladex (goserelin acetate), others\]; anti-androgen therapy / androgen receptor inhibitors \[Zytiga (abiraterone), Xtandi (enzalutamide), Erleada (apalutamide), Nubeqa (darolutamide)\]; cytotoxic agents / chemotherapy \[Taxotere (docetaxel), Jevtana (cabazitaxel)\]; bone metastases-targeted agents / targeted radiotherapy \[Xofigo (radium-223 dichloride)\]; therapeutic vaccine / immunotherapy \[Provenge (Sipuleucel- T)\]; PARP inhibitors \[Lynparza (Olaparib), Rubraca (rucaparib)\], pipeline analysis and geography.
