The basic principle of infection prevention and control is hygiene. Infection control (WHO) ensures the protection against acquiring an infection both in the general community and while receiving care due to health problems, in a range of settings. Biosafety addresses the safe handling and containment of infectious microorganisms and hazardous biological materials. Biosafety utilizes a combination of risk assessment and containment principles to reduce or prevent exposures to research personnel working with infectious agents (CDC and NIH). While the overall goal of biosafety and infection control is containment of the pathogen, mainly focused on reducing the spread of disease; whereas, in biosafety, the focus is on containing the infectious organism during research so the worker or environment does not become infected or contaminated. Infection control in hospitals deals with improving patients’ safety and combating infections, whereas biosafety deals with recognizing the intrinsic hazards of potentially pathogenic organisms, categorizing them according to risk assessments and implementing barriers that prevent acquisition of these pathogens while handling them. Biological safety also refers to the safe handling of biological materials by means of techniques, equipment and containment conditions to prevent personal, laboratory and environmental exposure to potentially infectious agents or biohazards.

The global infection control and biosafety products market segmentation is based on product type (healthcare-associated infection (HAI) prevention products and services – medical waste disposal products and services, single-patient-use medical device reprocessing services, automated patient surveillance systems; injection devices and related products – skin puncture devices, standard disposable needles and syringes, safety needles and syringes, sharps disposal products; bacterial and viral diagnostic products – bacterial infectious disease diagnosis, viral infectious disease diagnosis; sterilization equipment, services, and supplies – sterilization equipment, sterilization services, sterilization supplies).
