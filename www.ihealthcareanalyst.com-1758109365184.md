Hot flushes are a common symptom of the menopause experienced by most of the menopausal women as a sudden feeling of warmth or heat in the body, which are usually most intense over the face, neck and chest. Hot flushes may occur on their own but are often accompanied by night sweats or excessive sweating during the day. Other causes of hot flashes include breast and prostate cancer treatments.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment for menopausal hot flashes. However, long term HRT has an increased risk of breast cancer and risk associated with increasing age such as stroke, blood clots, and other health related problems. Estrogen and progesterone are the most common hormonal regimens used to reduce hot flashes.

Estrogen is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms as it reduces the severity of vasomotor symptoms, often with improvement beginning within the first week of treatment. Other drugs used for the treatment of hot flashes include combination of bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens, certain antidepressants, and other prescription medications.
