Apheresis is a medical technology in which the blood of a donor or patient is passed through an apparatus that separates out one particular constituent and returns the remainder to the circulation. Apheresis is also defined as “withdrawal of blood from a donor’s body, removal of one or more blood components (as plasma, platelets, or white blood cells), and transfusion of the remaining blood back into the donor”. Increasing prevalence of blood related disorders and other chronic disorders like cancer, autoimmune diseases are expected to drive the aphaeresis equipment market. The major types of apheresis are donor apheresis and therapeutic apheresis. The various procedures of apheresis include plasmapheresis, LDL-apheresis, photopheresis, plateletpheresis, erythrocytapheresis, leukapheresis, and other forms such as lipidpheresis and lymphopheresis.
