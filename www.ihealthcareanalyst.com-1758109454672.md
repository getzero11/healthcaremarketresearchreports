Health IT (health information technology) is the area of IT involving the design, development, creation, use and maintenance of information systems for the healthcare industry. Automated and interoperable healthcare information systems are expected to improve medical care, lower costs, increase efficiency, reduce error and improve patient satisfaction, while also optimizing reimbursement for ambulatory and inpatient healthcare providers. The electronic health record (EHR) is the central component of the health IT infrastructure. Other key elements of the health IT infrastructure are the personal health record (PHR), which is a person’s self-maintained health record, and the health information exchange (HIE), a health data clearinghouse or a group of healthcare organizations that enter into an interoperability pact and agree to share data between their various health IT systems.

The global health information technology market segmentation is based on Software Type (healthcare system applications – administrative information systems; ancillary information systems – laboratory information systems, pharmacy information systems; clinical information systems – computer aided diagnosis, electronic medical record, nursing information systems, medical imaging and surgery training, and mhealth applications), service type (mhealth – diagnostic services, information and reference services, monitoring services, prevention services, treatment services, wellness services; telehealth – healthcare diagnostics, healthcare education, remote patient monitoring, electronic prescribing software and online support; healthcare system strengthening solutions – emergency response services, healthcare practitioner support, healthcare surveillance), and end users (individuals, physicians, public/private institutions).

The global health information technology market report provides market size ($Million 2023 to 2033), market share and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033). The global health information technology market research report is further segmented by geography into North America (U.S., Canada), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Rest of LA), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Rest of EU), Asia Pacific (Japan, China, India, Rest of APAC), and Rest of the World.
