Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers in the [U.S.](https://www.cancerresearch.org/we-are-cri/home/cancer-types/bladder-cancer), affecting men more likely than women, with an estimated 77,000 new cases predicted to be diagnosed in 2016. Bladder cancers are clinically categorized as non-muscle invasive (NMIBC), muscle invasive (MIBC) or metastatic, and approximately 90% of cases of bladder cancer are urothelial (transitional cell) carcinomas. For NMIBC and MIBC, transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) is standard; adjuvant intravesical (local) chemotherapy or immunotherapy with bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) may follow. For MIBC, cystectomy with or without (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended. Chemotherapy, most commonly comprising platinum agents, has remained the mainstay of treatment for metastatic disease over the past decades. Immunotherapy has seen and continues to deliver promising results in the treatment of bladder cancer, there are numerous immune-based treatments for bladder cancer currently in development, with immunotherapy clinical trials for bladder cancer patients on the rise. The biological pipeline drugs considered in the study includes programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) inhibitors as atezolizumab (Tecentriq), durvalumab and avelumab; programmed cell death 1 (PD1) inhibitors as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo); cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) inhibitors as tremelimumab; and angiogenesis inhibitors as ramucirumab (Cyramza). Bladder cancer immunotherapy has significantly reduced the risk of recurrence for bladder cancer, while also increasing the percentage of patients with complete response post-surgery. New and developing bladder cancer immunotherapies have the potential to reduce recurrence rates and improve survival rates for patients with bladder cancer.

The global bladder cancer biologics pipeline market analysis segmentation is based on drug class – angiogenesis inhibitors, cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) inhibitors, programmed cell death 1 (PD1) inhibitors, and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) inhibitors.
