Mechanical ventilators help patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Mechanical ventilation refers to artificial breathing devices used by patients that are unable to breathe naturally due to acute medical conditions.

The fundamental goals of mechanical ventilation (MV) are to improve pulmonary gas exchange and relieve respiratory distress, thus permitting lung and airway healing, while at the same time lessening the risk for iatrogenic complications. Mechanical ventilation, assisted ventilation or intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), is the artificial ventilation where mechanical means are used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.

The difficulties with manual ventilation highlighted the need for mechanical devices. Mechanical ventilation is the most used short-term life support technique worldwide and is applied daily for a diverse spectrum of indications, from scheduled surgical procedures to acute organ failure.

The main indications that require mechanical ventilation intervention include airway protection for a patient with a decreased level of consciousness (such as head trauma, stroke, drug overdose, anesthesia), hypercapnic respiratory failure due to airway, chest wall, or respiratory muscle diseases, hypoxemic respiratory failure, or circulatory failure, in which sedation and MV can decrease the oxygen cost of breathing.

Depending on the patient’s condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing. Mechanical ventilation can be noninvasive, involving various types of face masks, or invasive, involving endotracheal intubation. Although, mechanical ventilators typically require power by a battery, some ventilators work on a pneumatic system.

Higher preference for high demand for technologically advanced medical devices, cost-effective alternatives by hospitals by transferring long term ventilated patients to home care settings are driving the portable and home care mechanical ventilators market worldwide.

Important advances have been made over the past decade towards understanding the optimal approach to ventilating patients with acute respiratory failure. Evidence now supports the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in selected patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and for facilitating the discontinuation of ventilatory support in patients with chronic pulmonary disease.

For example, a recent epidemiological study estimated that in the United States, approximately 300 persons per 100,000 adult population undergo invasive ventilation for nonsurgical indications.
