## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The development and implementation of highly multiplex molecular diagnostic tests have allowed clinical microbiology laboratories to more rapidly and sensitively detect a variety of pathogens directly in clinical specimens. The industry with new molecular diagnostic (MDx) tests is significantly less costly, while simultaneously increasing the number of targets per test through high multiplexing. The advanced technology has the potential to drive growth in the market, particularly in areas such as infectious disease testing, genetic analysis, and personalized medicine. Validation of a large number of disease markers in both molecular and protein diagnostics has paved the way for the emergence of the multiplex assay. The simple low-throughput multiplex assays followed by low-level multiplexing and high-throughput array-based immunoassays are replaced with two types of high-level multiplexing and high-throughput diagnostic methods using microspot arrays and bead arrays. Benefits of using multiplex molecular diagnostics array platforms include improved-quality patient care, as well as cost effectiveness and time saving.

The global multiplex molecular diagnostics market segmentation is based on technology (low density assays – quantitative PCR, microplate assays, medium density assays – bead-based arrays, antibody arrays, reverse arrays, mass spectrometry, high density assays – bacterial artificial chromosome arrays, protein arrays, very high density assays – oligonucleotide arrays, second generation sequencing, phage display), application (allergies, autoimmune diseases, cardiac diseases, infectious disease diagnostic, oncology, pregnancy & fertility testing), end users (academic research institutes, clinical research organizations, diagnostic laboratories, hospital, pharmaceutical companies).
