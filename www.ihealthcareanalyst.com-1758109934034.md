## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Dry eyes, also known as dry eye disease, dry eye syndrome, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) affect a significant number of people but treatment remains unsatisfactory. The cause of this condition may be anatomical or systemic. Most topical medications for dry eye disease seek to replace deficient growth factors and/or decrease inflammation on the ocular surface. The majority of new devices and procedures seek to treat meibomian gland dysfunction, with one new device stimulating tear production through utilizing the nasolacrimal reflex pathway.

The next step of treatment options includes preservative-free ocular lubricants, reversible punctal occlusion (punctal plugs), night-time ointment or moisture goggles, device-assisted heating and/or expression of the meibomian glands, intense pulsed light therapy, topical anti-inflammatory medications (corticosteroids, cyclosporine, lifitegrast), and oral antibiotics (macrolide or tetracycline).
