## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Liquid biopsy is a special type of blood test mainly used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for diseases such as cancer, with the added benefit of being largely non-invasive. In addition to blood, several other body fluids, such as urine, saliva, pleural effusions, and cerebrospinal fluid, can contain tumor-derived genetic information. Different liquid biopsy tests analyze different kinds of tumor material, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, tiny vesicles called exosomes, and whole cells.

Improvements in genomic and molecular methods are expanding the range of potential applications for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), both in a research setting and as a liquid biopsy for cancer management. Liquid biopsy tests can detect ctDNA in blood samples from cancer patients months before they were diagnosed by traditional methods, such as imaging tests.

Genomic profiles of circulating cell-free tumor DNA have been shown to closely match those of the corresponding tumors, with important implications for both molecular pathology and clinical oncology. The molecular profiles gathered from ctDNA can be further complemented with those obtained through analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), as well as RNA, proteins, and lipids contained within vesicles, such as exosomes.

Clinical applications of liquid biopsies in early-stage cancer patients include early detection of small tumors, improved risk assessment, and monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD). The liquid biopsy product sales are driven by increasing prevalence of cancer and subsequent testing volume, advances in sequencing and liquid biopsy technologies, and aging population worldwide. The global market for liquid biopsy products is projected to increase rapid growth rate throughout the forecast period.
