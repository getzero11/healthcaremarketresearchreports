Unilateral deafness or single-sided deafness (SSD) is a condition where an individual has non-functional hearing in one ear and receives no clinical benefit from amplification in that ear, with the contralateral ear possessing normal audiometric function. Although single-sided deafness cannot be cured, treatment options include hearing devices that can restore the sensation of hearing from both sides. SSD is severe to profound sensorineural loss in one of the ears.

The available treatment options can restore the sense of hearing on the deaf side. These treatment options (bone conducting and air conducting hearing aids) are available with different benefits and usage methods catering to various target groups. The BAHA (bone attached hearing aid) is essentially a hearing aid attached to a “stud” which is screwed into the back of skull bone, and it works very well, but is invasive. Currently, the BAHA system is worn by 15,000 people worldwide.

The CROS aid is basically a microphone disposed on the “deaf” side, that is used to provide sound to the “good side”. It requires putting in a device into the good ear. Most people are very unenthused about the CROS aid. It is also called the “bicross” hearingaid. The Trans-ear, a fairly new device, is similar to a BAHA, but the hearing aid goes into the bad ear rather than being clipped onto a stud.
