Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is a minimally invasive but highly effective procedure used to diagnose lung cancer, infections, and other diseases causing enlarged lymph nodes in the chest. Endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscopy provides real-time imaging of the surface of the airways, blood vessels, lungs, lymph nodes, and to identify difficult-to-reach tumors. EBUS and guided sampling is gaining popularity rapidly.

The improved images allow the physician to easily view difficult-to-reach areas and to access more, and smaller, lymph nodes for biopsy with the aspiration needle than through conventional mediatinoscopy. The accuracy and speed of the EBUS procedure lends itself to rapid onsite pathologic evaluation. The development of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has transformed diagnosis and staging for lung cancer. It has also become an important diagnostic modality for benign diseases such as sarcoidosis. EBUS-TBNA has proved valuable for mediastinal lymph node staging of lung cancer. EBUS is cost-effective as it reduces the need for more morbid and costly invasive procedure like mediastinoscopy or thoracotomy.
