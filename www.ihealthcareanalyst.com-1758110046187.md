The obesity pandemic affects both wealthy and poor populations across high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Given the global obesity epidemic and the limitations of surgical interventions, there is high demand for effective and safe anti-obesity medications (AOMs).

Increasing evidence has shown that behavior-based interventions with one of these medications can result in greater weight loss than that elicited by usual care conditions.
