## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). Proper diagnosis and treatment can help people with bipolar disorder lead healthy and active lives. Mental healthcare providers usually diagnose bipolar disorder based on a person’s symptoms, lifetime history, experiences, and, in some cases, family history.

Prevalence studies estimate about 1% of the population for bipolar I disorder, another 1% for bipolar II disorder, and up to 5% for the full spectrum of bipolar disorder diagnoses, with relatively similar prevalence in men and women, and across cultural and ethnic groups.

Recurrent episodes of mania and depression can cause serious impairments in functioning, such as erratic work performance, increased divorce rates, and psychosocial morbidity. The disease burden is heavy, with lifelong treatment requirements.

Medications generally used to treat bipolar disorder include mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics.
