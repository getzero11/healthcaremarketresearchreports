Soft tissue injuries are the most common injury in sport, but they also occur on a regular basis in the workplace, as a result of car accidents, in slip-and-falls, and even in day-to-day lives. Soft tissue injuries occur when muscles, ligaments, or joints become damaged through direct trauma (sudden strain or overloading, such as whiplash following a car accident) or indirect trauma (repeated strain or overloading, such as tendonitis).

The most common soft tissues injured are muscles, tendons, and ligaments. These injuries often occur during sports and exercise activities, but sometimes simple everyday activities can cause an injury. Sprains, strains, and contusions, as well as tendinitis and bursitis, are common soft-tissue injuries. Even with appropriate treatment, these injuries may require a prolonged amount of time to heal.
