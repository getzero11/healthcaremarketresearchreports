## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Treatments for different brain tumors will depend on symptoms, location and biological aggressiveness of the tumor, the extent of possible surgical resection, and the tumor tissue pathology characteristics. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted biological agents, or a combination of these. In the past two decades, researchers have developed new techniques of delivering radiation that target the brain tumor while protecting nearby healthy tissues. These treatments include brachytherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and radiosurgery.

Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy x-rays or other particles to destroy tumor cells. Radiation therapy may be advised for tumors that are sensitive to other treatments. Conventional radiation therapy uses external beams of x-rays, gamma rays or protons aimed at the tumor to kill cancer cells and shrink brain tumors. The most common type of radiation treatment is called external-beam radiation therapy, which is radiation given from a machine outside the body. When radiation treatment is given using implants, it is called internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy. A radiation therapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of treatments given over a set period of time.

Types of radiation therapy include intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), brachytherapy, proton therapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery.
