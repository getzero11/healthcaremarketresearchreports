## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Peptide drugs offer certain advantages as drugs due to their high biological activity, high specificity and low toxicity. Currently, most peptide drugs are administered by the parental route and approximately 75% are given as injectables. However, alternative administration forms are gaining increasing traction, including oral, intranasal, and transdermal delivery routes. The United States (US) and European Union (EU) are the major markets for drugs of all kinds and, as a consequence, first approvals for peptide therapeutics have occurred primarily in one of these two regions. The near-term prospects for additional approvals are excellent because the pipeline includes more than a dozen molecules in late-stage clinical studies and marketing approval applications. Recent successes in the development of peptides as therapeutics are likely to spur additional growth in this sector.

The global peptide therapeutics market report estimates the market size ($million 2023 to 2033) for key market segmented by the drug category (branded and generic), routes of administration (oral and parenteral), therapeutic application (Acromegaly; Cancer – Zoladex, Velcade, Lupron/ Enantone/ Eligard; Cardiovascular – Angiomax, Integrilin; Central Nervous System – Copaxone; Gastrointestinal Disorders – Gattex, Linzess; Hematological Disorders – Firazyr, Kalbitor; Infection –Incivek, Victrelis; Metabolic Disorders – Victoza, Byetta; and Respiratory Disorders), and also forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).
