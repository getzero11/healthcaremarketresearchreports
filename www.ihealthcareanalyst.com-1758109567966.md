## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Casting equipment such as orthopedic cast, body cast, plaster cast, or surgical cast are frequently made from plaster or fiberglass, encasing a limb (or, in some cases, large portions of the body) to stabilize and hold anatomical structures, most often a broken bone (or bones), in place until healing is confirmed. Splinting equipment are used for support or immobilization of a limb or the spine in multiple situations, including temporary immobilization of potentially broken bones or damaged joints and support for joints during activity. Most of the orthopedic or musculoskeletal problems are caused due to vehicular accidents, sports and adventure-related injuries and age related orthopedic injuries. Various casting and splinting products are used to treat musculoskeletal problems.
