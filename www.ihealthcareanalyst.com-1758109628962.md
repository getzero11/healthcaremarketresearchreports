## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a challenging disease to diagnose accurately as it requires invasive investigations and significant experience to manage patients effectively. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive disorder, characterized by high blood pressure in pulmonary arteries, which carry blood from the heart to the lungs.

PAH is a very rare condition that occurs when pulmonary arteries become narrow in diameter or get blocked. However, there are treatments available in the market that can help patients manage the symptoms of PAH.

Prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5), and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators are the major classes of drugs that are used to manage PAH symptoms.

The PAH treatment may include pills such as  ambrisentan (Letairis), bocentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit), riocigaut (Adempas), selexipag (Uptravi), sildenafil (Revatio), tadalafil (Adcirca), treprostinil (Orenitram); inhalers such as Iloprost tromethamine (Ventavis), treprostinil (Tyvaso); and intravenous drugs such as epopostenol sodium (Flolan, Veletri), treprostinil.
