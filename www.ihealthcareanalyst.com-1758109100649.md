## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder which results in excessive destruction of red blood cells leading to anemia. There are two primary types of Thalassemia disease: Alpha Thalassemia disease and Beta Thalassemia disease. Thalassemia major is the most severe form of beta thalassemia.

Thalassemia is relatively rare in the United States but common in Mediterranean regions and South and Southeast Asia. The disease is most frequent in the temperate regions of the world. Heart, liver and other organ failure due to iron toxicity is the leading cause of death for thalassemia patients in the developed world. It is estimated that 70 000 children are born with various forms of thalassemia each year. Although originated in the Mediterranean, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and the southern regions of Asia, because of relatively recent migrations, thalassemia is now frequently encountered in northern Europe and North America.

The treatment for thalassemia depends on the type and severity of disease. Some of the treatments include blood transfusions, bone marrow transplant, medications and supplements, and possible surgery to remove the spleen or gallbladder. The management of β-thalassemia still largely depends on supportive care, with regular lifelong red blood cell transfusions and iron chelation. Bone marrow transplantation has offered a definitive cure for the fraction of patients with available donors. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the only curative treatment option, is not feasible for most patients, even in economically developed countries, because of a lack of suitable donors. The introduction of the oral iron chelators deferiprone that preferentially chelates hearth iron and the development of novel NMR diagnostic methods has led to reduced mobility, increased survival and improved quality of life. More recently, major advances have being made in the discovery of critical modifier genes, such as Myb and especially BCL11A (B cell lymphoma 11A), a master regulator of HbF (fetal hemoglobin) and hemoglobin switching.
