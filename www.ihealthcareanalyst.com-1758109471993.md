Psoriasis is a long-lasting autoimmune disease which is characterized by patches of abnormal skin. It is often diagnosed or at least suspected on the basis of its appearance and distribution. There is no cure for psoriasis, however, various treatments can help control the symptoms.

Topical treatments such as form of lotions, foams, creams, ointments, gels, and shampoos containing steroids, tar preparations, and calcium- modulating drugs are very useful because they are relatively safe, fairly effective, and can be applied directly to the affected skin.

Most oral medications act by targeting portions of the immune system. Phototherapy or light therapy involves exposing the skin to ultraviolet light on a regular basis and under medical supervision.

Biologic drugs are usually prescribed for moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis that has not responded to other treatments.

Treatments for more advanced psoriasis include narrow-band ultraviolet B (UVB) light, psoralen with ultraviolet A (UVA) light retinoids (isotretinoin \[Accutane, Claravis\], acitretin \[Soriatane\]), methotrexate (particularly for arthritis), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), adalimumab (Humira), apremilast (Otezla), and secukinumab (Cosentyx). Currently, calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) are approved only for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.

Vitamin D analogues such as Calcipotriene (Dovonex) slow down the growth of skin cells.
