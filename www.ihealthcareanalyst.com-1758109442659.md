Natural language processing (NLP) is process of using of computer algorithms to identify key elements in everyday language and extract meaning from unstructured spoken or written input.  NLP is a discipline of computer science that requires skills in artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and other machine learning disciplines. Specific tasks for NLP systems may include: Summarizing lengthy blocks of narrative text, such as a clinical note or academic journal article, by identifying key concepts or phrases present in the source material, Mapping data elements present in unstructured text to structured fields in an electronic health record in order to improve clinical data integrity, Converting data in the other direction from machine-readable formats into natural language for reporting and educational purposes, Answering unique free-text queries that require the synthesis of multiple data sources, Engaging in optical character recognition to turn images, like PDF documents or scans of care summaries and imaging reports, into text files that can then be parsed and analyzed, and Conducting speech recognition to allow users to dictate clinical notes or other information that can then be turned into text.

The global natural language processing in healthcare market segmentation is based on technology (automatic summarization, information extraction, machine translation, text and voice processing), type of solutions (rule-based NLP, statistical NLP, and hybrid NLP), type of services (professional services, support and maintenance services) and deployment model (on-premises and on-demand).
