## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The dermatome devices are surgical instrument for producing thin slices of skin from a donor area, for use in skin grafts. One of its main applications is for reconstituting skin areas damaged by grade 3 burns or trauma. Dermatomes can be operated either manually or electrically. The dermatomes which were operated by air pressure, such as the Brown dermatome, achieved higher speed and precision. Electrical dermatomes are better for cutting out thinner and longer strips of skin with a more homogeneous thickness.
