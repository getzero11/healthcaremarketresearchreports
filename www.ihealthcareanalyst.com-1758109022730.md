Joint arthroplasty or replacement arthroplasty or joint replacement surgery involves replacement of arthritic or dysfunctional joint surface with an orthopedic prosthesis or prosthetic implant. It is an orthopedic surgical procedure where the articular surface of a musculoskeletal joint is replaced, remodeled, or realigned by osteotomy or some other procedure. The procedure tends to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis or some other type of trauma.

Joint replacement surgeries are performed when severe joint pain or dysfunction is not alleviated by less-invasive therapies. Several conditions such as such as osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), avascular necrosis (AVN) or osteonecrosis (ON), congenital dislocation of the hip joint (CDH) or hip dysplasia, acetabular dysplasia (shallow hip socket), frozen shoulder, loose shoulder, traumatized and misaligned joint can cause joint pain and disability and lead patients to consider joint replacement surgery.

Hip replacement is currently the most common orthopedic operation, though patient satisfaction short- and long-term varies widely. The average cost of a total hip replacement in 2012 was $40,364 in the United States, and about $7,700 to $12,000 in most European countries. Knee replacement or knee arthroplasty surgical procedure replaces the weight-bearing surfaces of the knee joint to relieve pain and disability. It is most commonly performed for osteoarthritis, and also for other knee diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.

Shoulder replacement surgical procedure replaces part of the glenohumeral joint to relieve arthritis pain or fix severe physical joint damage. Ankle replacement, or ankle arthroplasty replaces the damaged articular surfaces of the human ankle joint with prosthetic components. This procedure is becoming the treatment of choice for patients, replacing the conventional use of arthrodesis, i.e. fusion of the bones. The restoration of range of motion is the key feature in favor of ankle replacement with respect to arthrodesis.

The global joint arthroplasty devices market segmentation is based on procedure type (value & volume) – ankle arthroplasty; elbow arthroplasty (total elbow replacement, hemiarthroplasty); hip arthroplasty (total hip arthroplasty – cemented hip arthroplasty, cementless hip arthroplasty, hybrid hip replacement, partial hip arthroplasty, hip resurfacing, revision hip surgeries); knee arthroplasty (total knee arthroplasty, unicondylar knee arthroplasty, revision knee arthroplasty); shoulder arthroplasty (total shoulder arthroplasty, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, shoulder hemiarthroplasty, shoulder resurfacing, revision shoulder arthroplasty).
