## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The surgical navigation systems are designed to optimize space and surgical workflow in the OR and improve clinical outcomes by enabling surgeons to perform more precise procedures. Surgical navigation systems are majorly used to perform neurosurgeries, spinal surgeries, orthopedic surgeries and ENT surgeries.

The systems empower surgeons to make data-driven decisions in the OR by integrating the most advanced surgical planning software, instrument tracking technologies and intra-operative imaging. Surgical navigation systems facilitate minimally invasive surgeries that include use of medical imaging modalities to gain accuracy through the images generated.

These systems facilitate reaching precise area of interest and avoid damage to healthy tissues during surgical procedures. Moreover, surgical navigation systems enable rapid healing of surgical wounds, which reduces hospital stay. The surgical navigation systems also allow surgeons to precisely track their surgical instruments in relation to patient anatomy.
