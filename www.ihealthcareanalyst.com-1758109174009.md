## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous (benign) enlargement of the prostate gland that can make urination difficult. Symptomatic BPH affect over 100 million men worldwide, resulting in painful symptoms and lower quality of life. BHP becomes increasingly common as men age, especially after age 50.

If drugs are ineffective, surgery can be performed. The most common surgical procedure is transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), where sometimes a laser is used during TURP. Technical advances have greatly improved the safety of TURP.

Various alternative surgical treatments offer less rapid symptom relief than TURP, with the low risk of complications. These minimally invasive treatments include microwave heat (transurethral microwave thermotherapy or hyperthermia – TUMT), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), radiofrequency waves (radiofrequency vaporization), ultrasound (high-intensity focused ultrasound – HIFU; not approved in the United States), electric vaporization (transurethral electrovaporization), water-induced thermotherapy – transurethral water–jet ablation (TWJA), prostate artery embolization (PAE), prostatic stent insertion, prostatic urethral lift (PUL) and laser therapies – including include holmium laser ablation (HoLAP), photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP),   greenlight laser, thulium laser (ThuLEP) or holimum laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP).
