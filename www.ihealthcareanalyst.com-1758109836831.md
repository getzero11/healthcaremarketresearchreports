## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Most blood banks split the whole blood into two or more components such as red cell concentrate, platelet concentrate, fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate and fibrin glue. Every year millions of units of blood are donated globally and this donated blood is necessary for transplantation, cancer therapies, accident victims and for patients undergoing other forms of surgeries. Blood plays a unique role in life saving, but can also be a potential vector for infectious diseases and sometimes proves to be fatal. Growing concerns about spread of infectious diseases through donated blood has surged the demand for blood and blood products. Therefore, availability of safe blood is integral in surgical and other transfusion procedures. The blood supply is subjected to rigorous mandatory testing, screening and other safety measures at each step of collection, processing and storage. Causative pathogens challenge the safety of the blood and new ones continue to evolve in blood supply over time.
