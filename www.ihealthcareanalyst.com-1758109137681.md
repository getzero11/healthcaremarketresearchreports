Molecular diagnostic tests are increasingly being used to predict a blood group phenotype to improve transfusion medicine. The classical method of testing for blood group antigens and antibodies is hemagglutination. High-throughput DNA arrays provide a means to test a relatively large number of donors, thereby opening the door to change the way antigen-negative blood is provided to patients. Access to cost-efficient, high-resolution genotyping has the potential to increase the quality of care by decreasing the risk for alloimmunization and incompatible transfusions on long-term blood transfusion protocols, including patient groups with hemoglobinopathies and other chronic diseases.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all donated blood be tested for transfusion transmissible infections. These include HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, _Treponema pallidum_ (syphilis) and, where relevant, other infections that pose a risk to the safety of the blood supply, such as _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (Chagas disease) and Plasmodium species (malaria).

In high income countries immunoenzymatic or chemioluminescence tests are routinely employed for TTIs screening. These sophisticated and often automated laboratory platforms require constant maintenance, regular supply of dedicated reagents and controls and must be operated by skilled laboratory personnel. All these features make their utilization and reliable functioning difficult in resource-limited and/or remote settings. According to the WHO, prevalence of transfusion-transmitted infections is much higher in low income countries compared to middle and high income countries due to non-availability of testing kits. Only [rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)](https://www.ihealthcareanalyst.com/report/rapid-medical-diagnostic-kits-market/) and some simple hemoglobinometers are normally encountered in the peripheral hospitals of low income countries. Due to economic and logistical constraints, RDTs are routinely used in many African blood centres to screen for transfusion transmissible infections (TTI).
