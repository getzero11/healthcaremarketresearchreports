## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) is narrowing of arteries outside the brain and heart. Peripheral vascular disease also is caused due to accumulation of plaque within the inside lining of arteries. There are certain risk factors for the growth PVD such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes and smoking. Insufficient blood flow and narrowing of arteries are the most common peripheral diseases caused due to plaque buildup. Higher incidence rate of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and obesity, geriatric population and high unmet need are the major factors driving the growth of the global peripheral vascular devices market.
