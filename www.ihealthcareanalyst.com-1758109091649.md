Medical waste is defined as any solid waste which is generated in the diagnosis, treatment (e.g. provision of medical services), or immunization of human beings in research and healthcare pertaining thereto, or in the production or testing of biologicals, as well as categories defined by the WHO. The [WHO](http://www.biomedicalwastesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WHO-classification-of-medical-waste.pdf) classified the medical waste into eight categories of medical waste as infectious waste, sharps, pathological, radioactive, chemical, pharmaceuticals, pressurized containers, and general waste. Biomedical waste management has recently emerged as an issue of major concern not only to hospitals, nursing home authorities but also to the environment. Major sources of medical waste generation include Govt. hospitals/private hospitals/nursing, homes/ dispensaries. Primary health centers, medical colleges and research centers/ paramedic services, veterinary colleges and animal research centers, blood banks/mortuaries/autopsy centers, biotechnology institutions, and production units.

Of all the healthcare waste (HCW), approximately 75-90% is unregulated or known as healthcare general waste and is categorized as non-infectious. The remaining 10-25% unregulated medical waste has to be handled with special care because it could pose a threat to the health, either by contaminating the environment or through direct contact. Healthcare risk waste (sharps and non-sharps) is being transported with increasing frequency in reusable waste containers in many countries to improve user safety, increase sustainability and reduce costs. It is also becoming increasingly common in avoiding the risk of pathogen or disease transfer.
