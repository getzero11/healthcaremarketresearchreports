## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Bone density or bone mineral density (BMD) is the amount of bone mineral in bone tissue. Bone density measurement is used in clinical medicine as an indirect indicator of osteoporosis and fracture risk. Bone densitometers are known to offer improved diagnostic sensitivity in cases of osteoporotic fractures, playing a vital role in diagnosis of fracture before it could occur. It is measured by a procedure called densitometry, often performed in the radiology or nuclear medicine departments of hospitals or clinics. The measurement is painless and non-invasive and involves low radiation exposure. There has been an increasing interest in orthopedic medical communities towards bone mineral content and density measurement in the axial and peripheral skeletal regions of the human body due to higher incidences of osteoporosis, rising aging population prone to loss of bone mass, globally.
