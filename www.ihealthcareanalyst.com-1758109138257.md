## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Cancer ablation has emerged as an important and efficacious treatment option for nonsurgical cancer patients. Ablation devices offer a minimally invasive alternative to traditional surgical treatment of liver, prostate, kidney and lung cancers, and it is growing rapidly owing to rising incidence of these soft tissue cancers and increasing awareness for minimally invasive treatments.

Tumor ablation technique used to deliver chemical, thermal, electrical, or ultrasonic damage to a specific focal tumor in an attempt to achieve substantial tumor destruction or complete eradication. The technology continues to advance by newer modalities including radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy, cryoablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, and irreversible electroporation.

The major tumor ablation technologies used in various cancer types include, cryoablation for (kidney cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer), laser interstitial thermal therapy for (brain cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer), microwave ablation for (kidney cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer), radiofrequency ablation for (liver tumors, lung tumors, kidney tumors, pancreatic cancer), and non-thermal ablation or irreversible electroporation for liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer.
