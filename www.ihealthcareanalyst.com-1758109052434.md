## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Endoscopic and pelvic surgery has important advantages over open surgery, such as less postoperative pain and faster recovery and short hospitalization. This has been proven today for most gynecologic interventions such as hysterectomy, pelvic floor surgery, fertility surgery, cancer surgery and endometriosis surgery.

Endoscopic and pelvic surgery represents the surgical aspects of interventional endoscopy, ultrasound, and other techniques in the fields of obstetrics, gynecology, and urology surgery. Recent technological advancements in endoscopic instrumentation and higher demand for minimally invasive surgeries have been the main growth drivers of global endoscopic pelvic surgery devices market.

The introduction of robot-assistance in the field of gynecological surgery and specifically the introduction of Da Vinci Surgical System in 2005, is one of the most remarkable breakthroughs that revolutionized the endoscopic pelvic surgeries of the future.

The advantages of robotic technique are smaller incisions, leading to lower morbidity, less postoperative pain and shorter hospital stays which are similar to any minimally invasive surgery. Moreover, significant demand and FDA approvals are likely to boost the [global endoscopy devices market](https://www.ihealthcareanalyst.com/report/endoscopy-devices-market/), which is estimated to reach $42.6 billion in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 5.3% over the forecast period.
