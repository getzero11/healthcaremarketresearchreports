The diagnosis of leukemia relies upon a multi-parametric approach involving a number of different pathology disciplines. Molecular methods are increasingly employed to help refine diagnosis, establish prognosis and determine the most appropriate treatment, including rational therapies targeting the underlying genetic lesion. Cancer diagnosis is currently undergoing a paradigm shift with the incorporation of molecular biomarkers as part of routine diagnostic panel. The molecular alteration ranges from those involving the DNA, RNA, microRNAs (miRNAs) and proteins. Blood cancers, also called hematologic malignancies, are the cancers of the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. These cancers can affect anyone, including children. Hematological malignancies account for 9.5% of new cancer diagnoses in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with blood cancers every year. The availability of advanced and sophisticated molecular diagnostic methods provides answers to questions regarding cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and best course of treatment.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by the production of immature white blood cells, whereas Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), leukemia of the B-cells is the most common form of leukemia in adults. Treatments include chemotherapy, biological agents, and transplant. Lymphomas are a broad group of blood cancers that affect T and B cell lymphocytes. Treatments of lymphomas include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. Molecular diagnostic tests detect mutations in DNA or RNA that are associated with blood cancers. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) regulate clinical molecular tests like all other clinical laboratory tests.

The global blood cancer molecular diagnostics market segmentation is based on technology platform (RT-PCR, DNA microarray, Lab-On-A-Chip (LOAC), next generation sequencing (NGS), multiplex conventional); by application or cancer type (leukemia, lymphoma).
