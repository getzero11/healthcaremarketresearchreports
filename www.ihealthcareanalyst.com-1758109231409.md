## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Transfection refers to the introduction of foreign DNA into bacterial and/or mammalian cells. It is an important tool used in studies investigating gene function and the modulation of gene expression, thus contributing to the advancement of basic cellular research, drug discovery, and target validation. Transfection technologies are widely used in cell research, recombinant protein production, drug discovery, gene therapy and therapeutics.

Transfection can be accomplished using chemical, biological, or physical methods. Common methods include electroporation, the use of a virus vector, lipofection, and biolistics. Many types of genetic material, including plasmid DNA, siRNA, proteins, dyes, and antibodies, may be transfected using any of these methods.

However, a single method cannot be applied to all types of cells; transfection efficiencies and cytotoxicity may vary dramatically and depend on the method, cell type being utilized, and types of experiments being performed. Therefore, to obtain high efficiencies, all relevant factors should be considered for planning and selecting the appropriate transfection method.
