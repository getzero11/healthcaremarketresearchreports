Many safe and effective OTC ophthalmic drugs or products from artificial tears and ointments to ocular decongestants for mild eye disorders are available for self-treatment. Many common eye (ocular) disorders disappear without treatment or can be managed by self-treating.

Some of the prescription medications for eye allergy include eyedrops (decongestant, antihistamine, mast cell stabilizer, corticosteroid, NSAID). allergy shots (immunotherapy), and non-sedating oral antihistamines; while over the counter medication includes artificial tears, decongestant eyedrops, and oral antihistamines.

Treatments for dry eye syndrome include artificial tears, gels, or ointments; corticosteroid drops; cyclosporine A drops; and punctal plugs. Supportive therapies to treat underlying causes of dry eye, such as meibomian gland dysfunction, include hot compresses, lid scrubs, and omega-3 supplements.

Although there is no cure for glaucoma, IOP-lowering eye drops are the current treatment strategy for most types of the disease. Corticosteroids are currently the only drugs in the United States approved for treating retinal disorders such as non-infectious uveitis, although their long-term use leads to side effects.
