The immunoassay analyzers are used in hospital and clinical laboratories to run automated biochemical tests to detect the presence and concentration of substances in the clinical samples. Immunoassay analyzers or instruments are bioanalytical devices that perform biochemical tests to detect or measure specific protein or other substances depending upon the reaction of an antigen (analyte) and an antibody.

There are many types of tests that immunoassay analyzers can perform, including testing for cancer markers, diagnosing infectious diseases, cardiac analysis, therapeutic drug monitoring, and allergy testing.

Immunoassay tests now a day exploring new avenues of applications in diagnosing infectious diseases, toxicology testing, detection of cancer biomarkers and other drug monitoring tests. Immunoassay techniques are especially suited for analyzing compounds that are present in extremely low concentration (nanogram to picogram) and without any prior treatments to enhance its detection.

The several kinds of immunoassays are based on: chemiluminescence, enzyme immunoassay, enzyme-linked Fluorescence, immunofluorescence, multiplexed assays and radioimmunoassay.

The global immunoassay analyzers market report estimates the market size ($million 2023 to 2033) and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).
