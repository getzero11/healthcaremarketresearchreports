## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that arises from the cells of the proximal renal tubular epithelium. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 90–95% of cases. RCC occurrence shows a male predominance over women with a ratio of 1.5:1. The greatest risk factors for RCC are lifestyle-related; smoking, obesity and hypertension (high blood pressure) have been estimated to account for up to 50% of cases.

The type of treatment depends on multiple factors and the individual, some of which include the stage of renal cell carcinoma (organs and parts of the body affected/unaffected), type of renal cell carcinoma, pre-existing or comorbid conditions and overall health and age of the person. Different procedures may be most appropriate, depending on circumstances.

The recommended treatment for renal cell cancer may be nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy, surgical removal of all or part of the kidney. If cancer is only in the kidneys, which is about 60% of cases, it can be cured roughly 90% of the time with surgery. Percutaneous ablation therapies use image-guidance by radiologists to treat localized tumors if a surgical procedure is not a good option. The two main types of ablation techniques that are used for renal cell carcinoma are radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation.
