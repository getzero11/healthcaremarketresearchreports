## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Advances in information systems and technology in conjunction with outside forces requiring improved reporting are driving sweeping changes in the practice of radiology. Today in the hospital setting, several functions of the radiology information system (RIS), including order entry, patient registration, report repository, and the physician directory, have moved to enterprise electronic medical records.

The RIS is typically a system specifically designed to place radiology orders, to receive interpretations, and to prepare bills for patients. While most of the hospital enterprise spends the next several years going through the digital transformation converting from paper to a digital format, radiology can leap ahead in its use of analytics and information technology.
