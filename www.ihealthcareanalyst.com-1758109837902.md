## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Bone grafting is a surgical procedure that replaces the missing or damaged bone by natural or synthetic bone. There are three major types of bone grafts: autografts, allografts, and bone substitutes.

Modern bone grafts, bone grafts substitutes and bioactive factors enhance the natural healing process via osteoinductive, osteoconductive and osteogenic mechanisms in suboptimal conditions.

Autologous, allogenic and synthetic substrates contribute to modern fracture care and bone loss. Bone grafts and bone grafts substitutes should be biocompatible, osteoconductive, osteoinductive, structurally similar to bone, easy to use, and cost effective.

Autogenous bone grafts contain osteoblast and endosteal osteoprogenitor cells for regenerating the new bone, while limited supply and high donor site morbidity rate are major disadvantages associated with it.
