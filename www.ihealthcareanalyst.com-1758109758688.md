## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Multiplexed diagnostics involves analyzing large number of target analytes present in biochemical substances, cells of an organism, or an organic sample for disease diagnosis, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. Multiplexed diagnostics assays are preferred over single plex assays considering its low cost, high throughout nature and less turnaround time.

Multiplexed assays are also used in drug discovery and phases of clinical development in pharmaceutical industries, scientific research and genomic screening. Automation, technological advancement, widespread availability, and higher prevalence of cancer and infectious diseases has driven the growth of global multiplexed diagnostics market.

The global multiplexed diagnostics market report provides market size ($Million 2023 to 2033), market share and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).

The global multiplexed diagnostics market segmentation is based on technology (low-density multiplexed assays, medium-density multiplexed assays, high-density multiplexed assays, very high-density multiplexed assays, next-generation sequencing assays), application (allergies, autoimmune diseases, cardiac disorders, infectious disease diagnosis, oncology), and geography.

The global multiplexed diagnostics market research report is divided by geography (regional and country based) into North America (U.S., Canada), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Rest of LA), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Rest of EU), Asia Pacific (Japan, China, India, Rest of APAC), and Rest of the World.
