Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease condition, diagnosed typically with endoscopic and/or radiologic findings. The treatment of CD depends on disease severity, location of disease, and subtype of disease (inflammatory, stricturing, or penetrating). Some patients may require surgery for their disease, although it is not curative and patients still require ongoing therapy even after surgery for disease recurrence.

The prevalence of CD has an incidence of 3 to 20 cases per 100,000. Crohn disease is more common in the industrialized world, particularly in North America and Western Europe, though the incidence is rising in Asia and South America.

There are several different drugs used to treat CD. The generic drugs include aminosalicylic acid and similar agents (mesalamine, sulfasalazine), calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine), and locally-acting corticosteroids (budesonide, hydrocortisone, prednisolone). The immunosuppressants (azathioprine and MTX) have been used for many years to treat CD, but because of slow onset of action they are typically used to maintain remission.

More recently, these drugs are used in combination with anti-TNF drugs to decrease their immunogenicity and increase anti-TNF drug concentrations. The mainstay of therapy for CD has been anti-TNF agents. Currently, 3 anti-TNF agents are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for moderate to severe CD: infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol. More recently approved drugs are monoclonal antibodies directed against certain integrins (α4 or α4b7) or interleukins (IL-12/IL-23).

Some of the public organizations involved in Crohn disease research include [American Gastroenterological Association](https://www.gastro.org) (AGA), [Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation](http://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org), and [European Federation of Crohn’s & Ulcerative Colitis Associations](http://www.efcca.org) (EFCCA).
