Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is liver inflammation and damage caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. It is part of a group of conditions called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the causes of fatty liver, occurring when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver due to causes other than excessive alcohol use.

The more severe form of NAFLD is called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD spans a spectrum of clinicopathologic entities from simple hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nearly 10% to 20% of the general population affected by NAFLD suffers from NASH.

Therefore, the diagnosis methods for NAFLD helps in the prediction of NASH occurrence. In the United States, NASH-associated cirrhosis is currently the third most frequent reason for liver transplantation and is predicted to become the leading cause and it is projected to overtake Hepatitis C as the leading cause of liver transplants in the U.S. by 2020.

No medicines have been approved to treat NAFLD and NASH, however, some studies suggest that pioglitazone (Actos), a medicine for type 2 diabetes, improves NASH in patients without diabetes. Lifestyle changes are encouraged for patients with NASH, including reducing body weight, following a balanced diet, increasing physical activity, and avoiding alcohol.

The NASH therapies in clinical pipeline (phase II and III) include Aramchol, ARI 3037MO, BMS-986036, Cenicriviroc (TBR-652), Elafibranor (GF-505), Emricasan (IDN-6556), GR-MD-02, GS-4997, Liraglutide (Victoza/Saxenda), Obeticholic acid (OCA/Ocaliva), Simtuzumab (GS-6624), Tipelukast, and Volixibat (SHP 626).
