## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Neuro-Interventional Devices are specialized medical tools designed for minimally invasive procedures that diagnose and treat complex neurological and vascular conditions in the brain, spine, and surrounding areas. These devices include catheters, stents, coils, and embolic agents, which allow surgeons to navigate the intricate network of blood vessels using imaging guidance like fluoroscopy and X-rays.

By enabling precise interventions, they play a crucial role in treating aneurysms, strokes, and arteriovenous malformations, reducing the need for open surgery and improving recovery outcomes. Advancements in neuro-interventional technology continue to enhance patient care, making procedures safer and more effective.
