The thyroid gland manufactures hormones that regulate the body’s metabolism (the process of creating and using energy). There are several different disorders that can arise when the thyroid produces too much hormone (hyperthyroidism) or not enough (hypothyroidism). Four common thyroid disorders include Hashimoto’s disease, Graves’ disease, goiter, and thyroid nodules. The most serious form of hypothyroidism is called myxedema, which can lead to coma and even death. An underactive thyroid gland affects all organs and functions within the body, leading to both physical and emotional symptoms. Thyroid gland is prone to several distinct problems including underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), and thyroid nodules, autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis), where hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are the most common disorders. Several therapeutic drugs are commercially available for these disorders. Hormone replacement drugs such as synthetic long acting thyroid hormones, levothyroxine and liothyronine are used for hypothyroidism, whereas hyperthyroidism is treated through therapeutics such as imidazole and propacil.
