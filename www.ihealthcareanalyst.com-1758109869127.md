## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Endometrial carcinoma or uterine cancer develops in the innermost lining of the uterus. It is the most commonly diagnosed gynecological cancer in developed countries. Uterine endometrial cancer is the most prevalent gynecologic malignancy in American women and a major cause of both morbidity and mortality.

The prevalence of endometrial cancer in the United States is 25.7/100,000 women per year. The lifetime risk for developing this disease is approximately 2.8% in American women. Over 60,000 new cases are expected during the next year.

The majority of diagnosed cases are early-stage cancer (stage I–II) with disease confined to the uterus; early-stage disease is treated surgically with curative intent. The treatment of advanced disease (stage III–IV), either newly diagnosed or recurrent, depends predominantly on histopathology, staging, grading and molecular markers of the tumor.

Uterine cancer medications include chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Options for adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer include hormonal, cytotoxic and emerging targeted treatments. So far, options for molecularly targeted treatment of endometrial cancer also are limited to trials.
