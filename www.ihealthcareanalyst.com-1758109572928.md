## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Medical gases in the pure form (carbon dioxide, helium, nitrogen, nitrous oxide and oxygen) and medical air are mainly used in hospitals, and healthcare facilities, while the gas mixtures are used for clinical and medical applications for patient diagnostics such as lung function testing or blood gas analysis.

Medical gases a find their indirect or direct application in the healthcare industry. Medical gas equipment refers to the equipment utilized for the production of medical gases. Medical gases are either directly administered to patients or are used in medical procedures mainly as coolants and sterilants.

Test gases are also used to calibrate and maintain medical devices used for the delivery of anesthetic gases. Similarly, in laboratories, controlled aerobic conditions are created using mixtures rich in oxygen and anaerobic conditions are created using mixtures rich in hydrogen or carbon dioxide.
