Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive procedure used to reduce pain by applying an electrical current produced by radio waves to heat up a small area of nerve tissue or to kill cancer cells. Radiofrequency ablation procedure involves a local anesthetic and mild sedation.

The RF ablation technology for pain management involves the ablation of nerves in and around the affected tissue that cause excruciating chronic pain. This procedure is primarily used to reduce chronic lower back and neck pain caused due to degeneration of joints (due to arthritis and other spinal conditions). The procedure involves heating a small area of nervous tissue under controlled temperature resulting in blockage of pain signals transmitting from that area, and thereby relieving the patient from chronic pain.
