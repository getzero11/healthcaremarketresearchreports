## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 10-15% of all lung cancers, and it’s less common than non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, SCLC is a very aggressive form of cancer that often goes undiagnosed until it’s more advanced, so the survival rate tends to be low. If the cancer is detected in its early stages, the chances of making a recovery are much higher.

Lung cancer overall is the second most common malignancy in both sexes in the United States, exceeded in frequency only by prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women. The incidence of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has declined over the last few years, as smoking rates have fallen. SCLC once accounted for 20-25% of all newly diagnosed lung cancers; it now comprises only about 13% of all lung cancers. For 2020, the estimates for lung cancer overall in the United States are 228,820 new cases and 135,720 deaths.

Although the incidence of lung cancer has been falling in the US, it is increasing at a staggering pace in developing countries due to the rising prevalence of tobacco use. According to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, about 2.09 million new cases of lung cancer and 1.76 million deaths from lung cancer occur annually throughout the world.

Treatment of limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS- SCLC) may include combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) may include immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Systemic platinum-based chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for SCLC, irrespective of stage of disease. The immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD1 inhibitors, CTLA4 inhibitors and PDL1 inhibitors have recently advanced the SCLC treatment paradigm.
