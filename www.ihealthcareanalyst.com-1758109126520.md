Surgical staplers and clip appliers are complex mechanical medical devices that have been on the market for years and are mature in their technology. The range of staplers consists of five established stapler categories (circular, linear, linear cutting, ligating and skin staplers), along with recent variations which lend themselves to minimally invasive surgery. Within each category, several commercial models are available, many of which have their own unique features.

Modern surgical staplers are either disposable and made of plastic, or reusable and made of stainless steel. Both types are generally loaded using disposable cartridges. The staple line may be straight, curved or circular. Circular staplers are used for end-to-end anastomosis and esophagogastric surgery. The instruments may be used in either open or laparoscopic surgery, different instruments are used for each application. Laparoscopic staplers are longer, thinner, and may be articulated to allow for access from a restricted number of trocar ports.

Surgical stapler is currently used widely and has become indispensable tool for thoracic surgery, especially for endoscopic surgery such as thoracoscopic lung lobectomy. These devices are used in gastrointestinal, gynecologic, thoracic, and many other surgeries to remove part of an organ (resection), to cut through organs and tissues (transection) and to create connections between structures (anastomoses). The benefit of using these devices allows for more complex procedures and shorter surgical procedure time. Surgical stapler allows simultaneous cut and suture procedures quickly in excellent quality.
