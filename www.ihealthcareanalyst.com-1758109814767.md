## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Wearable medical devices have expanded from hearing aids to heartbeat monitors to pain management and are capable of tracking vital signs (heart rate, sleep, ECG, pulse rate, etc.) and also have an increasing role in athletes training. Medical device wearables tend to target one of the four most prevalent chronic illnesses, such as congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and further technological developments are expected to enable remote monitoring. The wearable medical devices are designed to be sufficiently accurate and reliable for professional medical care. The devices can improve general health, address physical conditions and/or facilitate medical exams. Wearable devices can track nearly everything, from physical activity to sleep and exposure to sunlight. Their versatility and portability appeal to consumers and make them a consideration for providers that want to cut down on in-person visits and allow physicians to remotely check in on patients.
