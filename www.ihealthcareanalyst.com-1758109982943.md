## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Single-cell genome sequencing aims to increase our understanding of complex microbial ecosystems and disease in multicellular organisms by isolating the contributions of distinct cellular populations.

Single cell sequencing technologies can be used to detect the genome, transcriptome and other multi-omics of single cells. They can show the differences and evolutionary relationships of various cells. Recent technical improvements make single cell sequencing a promising tool for approaching a set of seemingly inaccessible problems.
