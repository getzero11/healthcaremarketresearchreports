Medical image processing, analysis, and visualization applications enables quantitative analysis and visualization of medical images of numerous modalities such as PET, MRI, CT, or microscopy. Imaging has become an essential component in many fields of bio-medical research and clinical practice. Biologists study cells and generate 3D confocal microscopy data sets, virologists generate 3D reconstructions of viruses from micrographs, radiologists identify and quantify tumors from MRI and CT scans, and neuroscientists detect regional metabolic brain activity from PET and functional MRI scans. Analysis of these diverse types of images requires sophisticated computerized quantification and visualization tools. Some of the benefits of medical image software analysis include machine learning systems to facilitate early diagnostics for higher cure and survival rates, neural networks for diagnosis validation, research-specific algorithms to find hidden patterns and valuable insights to improve drug development as well as examination of complex conditions with adverse symptoms, segmentation solutions to pinpoint a treatment area and thus minimize possible damage to healthy tissue during an invasive procedure, applications integrating 3D imaging with virtual reality (VR) devices to enable immersive training of health specialists, patient education, and advanced diagnostics.

The global medical image software analysis market segmentation is based on software type (integrated, standalone), imaging type (2D imaging, 3D imaging, 4D imaging), modality (CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, ultrasound, radiographic imaging, others), application (cardiology, dental, gynecology, nephrology, neurology, oncology, orthopedic, others), end users (ambulatory surgical centers, clinics, diagnostic centers, hospitals, research and academic institutes).
