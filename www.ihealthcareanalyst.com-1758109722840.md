## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Immunoassays are laboratory techniques based on the detection of antibody production in response to foreign antigens. Antibodies, part of the humoral immune response, are involved in pathogen detection and neutralization. Serology is the study of blood serum and other bodily fluids for the identification of antibodies. The applications of immunostaining are numerous, but are most typically used in clinical diagnostics and laboratory research. These biochemical and serological techniques are based on the detection and quantitation of antibodies generated against an infectious agent, a microbe, or non-microbial antigen.
