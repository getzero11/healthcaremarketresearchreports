## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Medical robotic systems allow surgeons greater access to areas under operation using more precise and less invasive methods. There are mainly six types of medical robotic systems: surgical (laparoscopy, neurosurgery, orthopedic, non-catheter), non-invasive (radiosurgery), prosthetic (knee, hands, legs), emergency, rehabilitation (robotic arms), and non-medical robotic systems (transportation).

The major advantages of medical robotic systems include improved surgical outcomes, accurate procedure execution and rapid post-surgical recovery of patients. From the incorporation of robots in basic activities such as assisting in surgeries and endoscopy, the scope of these devices has augmented to micro-surgeries, orthopedics, neurology, patient rehabilitation, diagnosis, emergency response and also in the non-medical applications such as material transportation and pharmacy management.

The global medical robotic systems market report estimates the market size ($million 2023 to 2033) and segmented by product \[surgical robots (laparoscopy robotic systems – Da Vinci robotic surgery system, freehand endoscope holder system, Telelap ALF-X endoscopic robotic surgical system), neurosurgery robotic systems (Neuromate surgical system, PathFinder surgical system, Renaissance (SpineAssist) surgical system), non-catheter percutaneous robotic systems (INNOMOTION robot arm system), orthopedic robotic systems (iBlock surgical system, MAKO RIO surgical system, NAVIO surgical system, ROBODOC surgical system, Sculptor Robotic Guidance Arm}, Steerable robotic catheters (Niobe remote magnetic navigation system, Sensei X robotic catheter system)\], non-Invasive radiosurgery robotic systems (CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery system, Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion radiosurgery system, TrueBeam STx radiosurgery system), emergency response robotic systems (AutoPulse Plus robotic system, LS-1 robotic system, others), prosthetics and exoskeletons (C-Leg knee prosthetic, i-Limb Ultra Hand prosthetic, ReWalk walking assistance exoskeleton, RHEO knee prosthetic), assistive and rehabilitation systems (Handy 1 assistive robot, iARM robotic arm, Lokomat robotic rehabilitation device, Myomo mobility system – muscle re-education device), non-medical robotics in hospitals (cart transportation robots, robotic hospital pharmacy, telemedicine robots (iRobot’s RP-Vita, Intouch Health’s RP-7i)\], by component (user interface, software, visualization systems, power sources, locomotion systems, safety systems) and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).
