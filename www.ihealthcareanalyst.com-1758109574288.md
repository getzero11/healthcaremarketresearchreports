Spectroscopy is the use of the absorption, emission, or scattering of electromagnetic radiation by atoms or molecules (or atomic or molecular ions) to qualitatively or quantitatively study the atoms or molecules, or to study physical processes. Atomic spectroscopy is the study of the electromagnetic radiation absorbed and emitted by atoms. Mass spectrometry, an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles. Molecular spectroscopy is the study of the interaction of electromagnetic (EM) radiation with matter. It is based on the analysis of EM radiation that is emitted, absorbed, or scattered by molecules, which can give information on: chemical analysis.

Based on technology, the global spectrometry equipment market is divided into three main sub-segments such as atomic spectrometry (atomic absorption, element analyzers, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission, X-Ray diffraction, and X-Ray fluorescence), mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS, GC-MS, ICP-MS, ion mobility and ion trap, MALDI-TOF, Q-TOF LC/MS, LC-MS, etc.), and molecular spectrometry (IR, Near IR, NMR, Raman, UV-Visible, etc.).
