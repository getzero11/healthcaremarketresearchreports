Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are micrometer-scale devices that integrate electrical and mechanical elements with sizes ranging from micrometers to millimeters. Microelectromechanical systems are defined as devices made up of miniaturized mechanical and electromechanical elements using micro fabrication techniques. MEMS comprise miniaturized structures which include sensors, actuators and microelectronics. The prime elements of an MEMS system are micro sensors and micro actuators. These are also called transducers and help in the conversion of one form into another form of energy. They have been used in diverse applications, from display technologies to sensor systems to optical networks. Micro sensor systems such as accelerometers, pressure, flow, optical imaging, and temperature sensors are used in biomedical field for wide range of applications such as diagnostics, monitoring, surgical and treatment or therapeutic devices. The end users of microelectromechanical systems mainly consist of home health care, medical research facilities, and hospitals.
