## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Detection and quantification of antibodies in the serum/plasma, offer a rapid and accurate assessment of vaccine responses. Dried blood spots (DBS) are useful for collecting blood from infants for diagnostic purposes, especially in low-income settings, as the amount of blood required is miniscule and no refrigeration is required. There is a good correlation between antibody concentrations in DBS and serum/plasma samples, supporting the wider use of DBS in vaccine and sero-epidemiological studies, but there is limited data on anti-bacterial antibodies.

DBS testing for decades has remained predominantly focused on the diagnosis of infectious diseases especially in resource-limited settings or the systematic screening of newborns for inherited metabolic disorders and only recently have a variety of new and innovative DBS applications begun to emerge.
