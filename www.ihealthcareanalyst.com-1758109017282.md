Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure used to visualize, diagnose, and treat problems inside a joint. The technique has drastically changed joint surgery, allowing it to view inside the joint through incisions as small as one centimeter in length.

Arthroscopic surgery has a wide range of applications in treating sports injuries of the ankle, elbow, hip, knee, shoulder, and wrist, among other sites; it also may be used to treat osteoarthritis in mid-stage patients with partially damaged cartilage or with a coexisting problem such as a meniscal tear or loose piece of cartilage. Sports medicine is a sub-specialty of orthopedics that deals with the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of injuries to all structures of the musculoskeletal system suffered during athletic activity.

Each year, nearly 2 million people in the US suffer sports-related injuries and receive treatment in emergency departments. In Europe, the number of sport injuries is increasing, most likely due to increased participation in sports. The share of women injured in sports accidents has been steadily increasing, which most likely reflects the increasing participation of women in athletics. At the same time, the incidence of sports injuries in European adolescents is increasing due to the increased popularity of sports and other outdoor activities.

The global arthroscopy and sport medicine devices market segmentation is based on product/device type – arthroscopy products (arthroscopic visualization products, fluid management products, manual arthroscopy instruments, powered arthroscopy instruments), and soft tissue fixation devices (ankle and elbow fixation devices, cruciate ligament fixation devices, hip fixation devices, meniscal fixation devices, shoulder fixation devices, wrist fixation devices).
