## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Articular cartilage is the soft white cartilage that covers the ends of the bones and helps joints to move smoothly.  It also helps to absorb the forces throughout the knee. Early identification and treatment of articular cartilage damage can have a significant effect on outcomes for patients.

X-rays are sometimes useful but an MRI scan provides doctors with the best pictures of the knee cartilages. By repairing or replacing the damaged cartilage before it completely wears out, the arthritic damage can be reversed and the joints preserved. With improvements to arthroscopes and higher resolution cameras, the procedure has become extremely effective for both the diagnosis and treatment of knee problems.
