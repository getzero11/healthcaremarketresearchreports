Most biopharmaceutical companies use mammalian cell line development technologies for the production of biotherapeutic proteins. Protein therapeutics (including monoclonal antibodies \[mAbs\], peptides and recombinant proteins) represent the largest group of new products in development by the biopharmaceutical industry. These protein biologics are used for treating a multitude of conditions, such as, autoimmune disorders, hematologic disorders, hormonal dysregulation, cancers, infectious diseases and genetic disorders. Although most biotherapeutic proteins developed to date have been produced using the mammalian Chinese hamster ovary and murine myeloma (NS0, Sp2/0) cell lines, there has been a recent shift toward the use of human cell lines, such as human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cell lines. Mammalian expression systems are generally the preferred platform for manufacturing biopharmaceuticals, as these cell lines are able to produce large, complex proteins with post-translational modifications (PTMs; most notably glycosylation) similar to those produced in humans. Currently, mammalian cell line development technologies used by most biopharmaceutical companies are based on either the methotrexate (MTX) amplification technology or glutamine synthetase (GS) system. Single cell cloning or limiting dilution is then performed to ensure that the selected cells for further processing are producing the recombinant protein. In general, the mammalian cell line development process typically requires 6 to 12 months and is a time, capital and labor intensive process.

The global mammalian cell line development market segmentation is based on process and technology (transfection and selection, single cell cloning technique – manual limited dilution technique, fluorescence activated cell sorter technique, clone picking technique, others); production method (in-house, outsource, combined, do-it-yourself).
