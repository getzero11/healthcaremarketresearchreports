## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Lyophilization or cryodesiccation or freeze-drying is used to preserve a perishable material or make the material more convenient for transport in industries such as bio-pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and nutraceuticals. Bio-pharmaceutical companies often use lyophilization to increase the shelf life of the products, such as vaccines and other injectables, while in microbiology it is used to conserve special bacterial or fungal strains. Lyophilization, also referred to as freeze drying, is a process applied for increasing the shelf -life of biological products such as vaccines, injectables, enzymes, proteins, antibodies, blood plasma, diagnostic reagents and nutritional supplements. With rising quality concerns, lyophilization of medical products has become essential, where Lyophilized products have proven to be much more safe and effective to administer after storing for a long period than the usual dried products.
