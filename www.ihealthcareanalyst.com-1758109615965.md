## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer (about 85% of lung cancers) and it usually grows and spreads more slowly than small cell lung cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma are all subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer is a major type of lung cancer, accounting about 80% to 90% of the total lung cancers, with one of the highest mortality rates. Treatment of NSCLC depends on the stage of cancer, type of NSCLC, type of mutation gene such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, and patient’s general health.

The global non-small cell lung cancer therapeutics market report estimates the market size ($million 2023 to 2033) for key market segmented by the drug class (brand/product) – \[angiogenesis inhibitors (Avastin, Cyramza); EGFR inhibitors (Tarceva, Gilotrif, Iressa); folate antimetabolites (Alimta); ALK inhibitors (Xalkori, Zykadia); microtubule stabilizers (Abraxane, Docetaxel); and PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibitors (Opdivo, Keytruda, Tecentriq, Imfinzi)\], by clinical pipeline \[Bavencio /Javelin (avelumab), Verzenio/Verzenios (abemaciclib), others\], and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).
