Nurse Call Systems (NCS) is designed keeping in view the relevance of quality nursing in today’s context. Installing NCS in the hospital enables efficient management of nursing staff. NCSs are ideal for hospitals and nursing homes. The nurse call systems require minimum or no training to the hospital staff. NCS enables real-time data logging of the patient calls to the nurses, whereas an IP based data analysis software provides detailed report of the services rendered to the patients. Some systems also allow the patient to speak directly to the staffer; others simply beep or buzz at the station, requiring a staffer to actually visit the patient’s room to determine the patient’s needs. In some facilities, often in hospitals, a more advanced system is included, in which staff from the nurse’s station can communicate directly with patients via intercom.

The global nurse call systems market segmentation is based on instrument type (buttons, integrated communication systems, intercoms, mobile systems), technology (wired communication, wireless communication), and end users (ambulatory services, assisted living centers, clinics, hospitals).
