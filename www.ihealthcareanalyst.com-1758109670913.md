## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The continuing advancement of next-generation technology in terms of data capacity per instrument run and read length is likely to accelerate the rate of whole genome sequencing, at ever-decreasing costs. Cancer genome sequencing refers to a method used to identify the complete DNA or RNA sequence of cancer cells based on the sequencing of a group of tumor cells.

The cancer genome engineering market is growing rapidly due to the technological advancements, government initiatives, R&D funding in the genome sequencing sector and higher incidence of cancer worldwide.

The next-generation platforms can produce data to characterize gene expression, methylation, histone packaging, transcription factor and other regulatory protein binding positions, where it is quite possible to comprehensively characterize a broad spectrum of genomic alterations among sets of tumor samples.

The global cancer genome sequencing market report estimates the market size ($million 2023 to 2033) and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).

The global cancer genome sequencing market segmented by technology (second generation sequencing, third generation sequencing, first generation sequencing), method (targeted genome sequencing, exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, de novo sequencing), cancer type (breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, other cancers), and geography.

The global cancer genome sequencing market research report is divided by geography (regional and country based) into North America (U.S., Canada), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Rest of LA), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Rest of EU), Asia Pacific (Japan, China, India, Rest of APAC), and Rest of the World.

The global cancer genome sequencing market report also provides the detailed market landscape (market drivers, restraints, opportunities), market attractiveness analysis and profiles of major competitors in the global market including company overview, financial snapshot, key products, technologies and services offered, and recent developments.
