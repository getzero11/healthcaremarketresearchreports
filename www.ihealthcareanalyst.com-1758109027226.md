## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Obesity is a major public health concern in the United States and has been linked to many health problems such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep disorders, and breathing problems.

According to 2015 estimates by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery ([ASMBS](https://asmbs.org/)), roughly 19 million US adults qualified as morbidly obese, and only estimated 196,000 bariatric surgeries were performed, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies, gastric bypass surgeries, and laparoscopic adjustable bands. Treatments for obesity range from healthy eating and exercise to prescription medicine and surgery. FDA-regulated medical devices also help treat obesity.

Currently, there are four types of FDA-approved devices on the market designed to treat obesity: gastric band are placed around the top portion of the stomach leaving only a small portion available for food (lap-band, realize band: Swedish adjustable gastric band), gastric balloon systems: inflatable balloons are placed in the stomach to take up space (ReShape Duo: integrated dual balloon system, Orbera intragastric balloon system, Obalon balloon system), gastric electrical stimulation systems: electrical stimulator is placed in the abdomen to block nerve activity between the brain and stomach (vBloc therapy systems, maestro rechargeable system), gastric emptying systems or aspiration systems: a tube is inserted between the stomach and outside of abdomen to drain food after eating (AspireAssist).
