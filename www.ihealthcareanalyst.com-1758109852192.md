## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Articular cartilage can be damaged by trauma or degraded by different forms of arthritis. Once damaged, cartilage is challenging to repair and currently impossible to fully regenerate. Cartilage tissue’s ability to repair itself is severely limited because it does not contain blood vessels, and bleeding is necessary for healing.

Injured cartilage typically requires several surgical techniques that attempt to repair, regenerate, and replace cartilage. These surgeries can be performed on almost any joint, but they are most commonly performed on knees.

They are generally appropriate for people who have specific cartilage injuries rather than widespread cartilage damage, like that found in moderate to severe knee arthritis. The contouring of cartilage reduces joint friction, which in turn can reduce knee pain, restore knee function, and potentially slow down future cartilage degeneration.
