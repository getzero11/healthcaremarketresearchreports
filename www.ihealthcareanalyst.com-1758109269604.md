Medical equipment calibration is the process of measuring and adjusting equipment against a reference standard with known values and measurements. Calibration is defined as an operation that, under specified conditions, performs two steps. In the first step, it establishes a relation between the quantity values with measurement uncertainties provided by measurement standards and corresponding indications with associated measurement uncertainties (of the calibrated instrument or secondary standard). In the second step, it uses this information to establish a relation for obtaining a measurement result from an indication. The purpose of calibration is to minimize any measurement error by ensuring the precision and accuracy of the instrument. The healthcare industry, calibration of medical equipment is required in order to ensure better patient safety. The market growth of these calibration services is driven by growing concerns for patient safety, and increasing number of medical device companies, etc.
