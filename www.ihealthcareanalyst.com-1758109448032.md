## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Biomedical microelectromechanical systems (Bio-MEMS) are MEMS that have biological and/or biomedical functions or applications. Bio-MEMS technology operates at the microscale for biological and biomedical applications. Some of its major applications include genomics, proteomics, molecular diagnostics, point-of-care diagnostics, tissue engineering, and implantable microdevices. Bio-MEMS pressure sensors have the largest class of applications including disposable blood pressure, intraocular pressure (IOP), intracranial pressure (ICP), intrauterine pressure, and angioplasty. Bio-MEMS accelerometers are used in defibrillators and pacemakers. Bio-MEMS hearing-aid transducer is an electroacoustic device used to receive, amplify and radiate sound into the ear. A POC diagnostic bio-MEMS system uses bodily fluids (saliva, blood, or urine samples) to perform sample preconditioning, sample fractionation, signal amplification, analyte detection, data analysis, and results display. Some of the bio-MEMS that are already being used and commercially marketed as well as a few still in the research phase include Lab-on-a-chip, Retina Array, Micro-pump for insulin, etc.

The global healthcare bio-MEMS market segmentation is based on product type (accelerometers and gyroscopes), and applications (bionics, cardio-MEMS, ENT implants, microsurgical tools, neural implants, point-of-care, tissue engineering, and others).
