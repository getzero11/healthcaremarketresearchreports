## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Ovarian cancer is a cancer that forms in or on an ovary.  It results in abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. In 2015, it was present in 1.2 million women and resulted in 161,100 deaths worldwide. The risk of ovarian cancer increases in women who have ovulated more over their lifetime. A family history of ovarian cancer is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. People with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventative measure.

Other risk factors include hormone therapy after menopause, fertility medication, and obesity. A diagnosis of ovarian cancer is confirmed through a biopsy of tissue, usually removed during surgery. Treatment usually includes some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Outcomes depend on the extent of the disease, the subtype of cancer present, and other medical conditions.

Chemotherapy in ovarian cancer typically consists of platins, a group of platinum-based drugs, combined with non-platins. Common therapies can include paclitaxel, cisplatin, topotecan, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and gemcitabine. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, bevacizumab (Avastin; Roche/ Genentech), is approved (excluding the United States) as a first-line treatment in combination with standard chemotherapy agents. In Europe and the United States, bevacizumab is also approved for recurrent ovarian cancer.
