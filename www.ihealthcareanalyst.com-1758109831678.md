## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The contrast media injectors are used to inject medical contrast medium (or contrast agents) to enhance the contrast of structures or fluids within the body in medical imaging (visibility of blood vessels and the gastrointestinal tract). Contrast media are used to enhance the quality of medical imaging such as CT, MRI, PET/CT and ultrasound. Their value has long been recognized by their regular use in the radiology department worldwide.

Contrast media injectors (CMI) refer to the equipment used to inject contrast media into the body that enhances the visualization of the specific organs and tissues, thereby improving the overall quality of medical imaging procedures. The recent advances with contrast media injector technology are cutting costs by reducing contrast waste and automated data collection for the treatment dose.
