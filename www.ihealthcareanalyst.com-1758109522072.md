## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Vaccination against a range of bacterial and viral infectious diseases is an integral part of communicable disease control world-wide. The most common and serious vaccine-preventable diseases tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO) are: diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b infection, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, pertussis, poliomyelitis, rubella, tetanus, tuberculosis, and yellow fever. Vaccines are known to be the safest, most effective way to prevent infectious diseases, and they have enabled the worldwide eradication of many devastating diseases like polio and smallpox. New safe and effective vaccines against infectious diseases are developed by studying the interactions between invading pathogens and the human immune system. Early immunization of infants and completion of the full schedule of vaccinations up to and through adulthood contributes to reducing the incidence and burden of vaccine preventable diseases. Very high immunization coverage can lead to complete blocking of transmission for many vaccine preventable diseases (VPD). The worldwide eradication of smallpox and the near eradication of polio from many countries provide excellent examples of the role of immunization in disease control. DTP combination vaccines include vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) that also contain one or more components to provide protection against other infections, including hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type B and/or polio. Meningococcal vaccines include meningococcal group A, C, W-135 and Y vaccines, meningococcal group B vaccines and meningococcal group C vaccines. Pentacel is a DTP, Haemophilus influenzae type B and polio vaccine. Pediarix is a DTP, hepatitis B and polio vaccine. Menactra and Menveo are meningococcal type A, C, W-135 and Y vaccines. Bexsero and Trumenba are meningococcal type B vaccines.

The global infectious disease vaccines market segmentation is based on type (brand) – Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis (DTP) combination vaccines (Boostrix, Pediarix, Pentacel, other, herpes zoster vaccines (Zostavax, Shingrix, other); human papilloma virus vaccines (Gardasil, other); influenza vaccines (Flulaval, Fluzone, other); meningococcal vaccines (Menveo, Bexsero, Menactra, Trumenba, other); pneumococcal vaccines (Pneumovax, Synflorix, Prevnar/Prevnar 13, other); rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix, Rotateq, other).
