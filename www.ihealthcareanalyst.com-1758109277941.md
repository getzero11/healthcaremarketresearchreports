## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Biochips, or microchips, are small, wafer-like components manufactured from substrates such as silicon, fused quartz, soda glass and plastic. Substrates are selected on the basis of chemical structure and physical attributes, such as conductivity, pliability and surface topography. In molecular biology, biochips are essentially miniaturized laboratories that can perform hundreds or thousands of simultaneous biochemical reactions. At present, applications are primarily focused on the analysis of genetic material for defects or sequence variations, whereas as there is a great potential of biochips to be used either as point-of-care diagnostics or as high-throughput screening platforms for drug lead identification. The most important growth driver of this market is the increasing application of genomics and proteomics in cancer treatment research, leading to an increase in the use of microarrays and reagents.
