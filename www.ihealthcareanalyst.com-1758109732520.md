## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Orthopedics is a branch of medicine science and surgery involving the use of orthopedic devices to correct various disorders and injuries of the bones and joints. Orthopedic devices are implants used to restore skeletal structure and joint movement after fracture, abnormal growth of bones, soft tissue damage, or other deformities. These devices can be surgically implanted or externally attached through minimally invasive procedures and can be classified into internal and external fixation devices. Increasing prevalence of osteoporosis is expected to drive the global small bone and joint orthopedic devices market. The condition affects the bones and increases the chances of fractures or bones breaking. Osteoporosis weakens the hips, spinal bones, knees, wrists, and joints. Joint implants are generally used to treat deformities in long and small bone and joints. Implants such as femoral head, humeral head, reverse shoulder prosthesis, prosthesis, and others assist in restoring proper joint movement.
