## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most common forms of leukemia. [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org) estimates about 20,110 new cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the United States for 2017. CLL accounts for about one-quarter of the new cases of leukemia. The main treatments used includes chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, targeted therapy, supportive care, and stem cell transplant.

There are 2 general categories of systemic therapy used for CLL: chemotherapy and targeted therapy. The types of chemotherapy drugs include Bendamustine (Treanda), Fludarabine (Fludara), Pentostatin (Nipent), Cladribine (Leustatin), Chlorambucil (Leukeran), and Cyclophosphamide (Neosar).

Targeted therapy treatment include monoclonal antibodies like Rituximab (Rituxan), Ofatumumab (Arzerra), Obinituzumab (Gazyva), and kinase inhibitors such as Ibrutinib (Imbruvica), Idelalisib (Zydelig), and Venetoclax (Venclexta). The following combinations may be used for CLL: Rituximab (Rituxan) and fludarabine (FR), Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (FC), Cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and rituximab (FCR), Pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (PCR), Bendamustine (Treanda) and rituximab (BR), Idelalisib and rituximab for patients with recurrent CLL, Obinituzumab and chlorambucil for older patients.
