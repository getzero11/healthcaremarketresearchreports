## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Medical device contract manufacturing is a type of outsourcing that involves the construction of finished products or, in some instances, a single element of a larger product, from low-volume prototypes to high-volume production. Generally, companies have the tendency to concentrate on a particular sphere of expertise, such as joining, converting, casting and molding, assembly, and R&D design. E.g. the manufacturing and assembly expertise serves multiple medical product specialties such as interventional products with pushing technology limits to help launching novel cardiac balloon catheter, surgical technologies with novel planetary extrusion cutter to reduce manufacturing time and improves quality, or single-use devices with multilayer tubing that solves redesign challenges for cardiovascular device. The medical device industry benefits from multiple attractive long-term trends, including aging population and longer life expectations, and greater demand for healthcare services. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are increasingly seeking to outsource manufacturing for a number of reasons such as OEM focus on core competencies, OEM margin pressure, technological advancements, new product development, market growth outpacing capacity expansion, shorter product lifecycles, and faster time to market.

The global medical device contract manufacturing market segmentation is based on product type (raw materials or components, finished goods or product, electronic manufacturing), and device type (Class I, Class II, Class III).
