_Helicobacter pylori_ infection can be diagnosed by invasive techniques requiring endoscopy and biopsy (histological examination, culture and rapid urease test) and by non-invasive techniques, such as serology, the urea breath test, and stool antigen detection. Some non-invasive tests, such as the urea breath test and the stool antigen test can detect active infection, while non-invasive tests are passive in nature. In gastrointestinal diagnostics, histological examination may yield important diagnostic information, culture tests may provide information on antibiotic resistance, and endoscopy is an expensive and invasive procedure.

In many situations, non-invasive testing may be more appropriate and cost effective. Non-invasive test-and-treat strategies are widely recommended in the primary care setting. The choice of appropriate test depends on the pre-test probability of infection, the characteristics of the test being used and its cost-effectiveness. The serological testing for antibodies is a rapid, simple and affordable test. Urea breath tests can be used for follow-up after treatment with eradication therapy, as an alternative to repeat endoscopy. The stool antigen test is an enzyme immunoassay designed to detect _H. Pylori_ in faecal specimens. Although, _H. pylori_ itself cannot be detected non-invasively, its urease activity can be detected by breath test.

Laboratory-based serological testing (e.g. the Meridian Diagnostics/ Launch Premier ELISA) has the advantage of requiring very little patient time. Unlike biopsy-based tests, which are site-dependent, serology has the advantage of avoiding possible sampling error. A number of near-patient or ‘office’ tests (e.g. Cortecs Helisal rapid blood test) have been developed, which are suitable for single use and require no special laboratory equipment or facilities, making them particularly convenient for use in general practice.
