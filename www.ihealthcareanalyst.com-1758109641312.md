## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The high demand for scalability, speed and low-cost sequencing has driven the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) or high-throughput sequencing. It has the potential to dramatically accelerate biological and biomedical research, by enabling the comprehensive analysis of genomes, transcriptomes and interactomes to become inexpensive, routine and widespread, rather than requiring significant production-scale efforts.

The global next-generation sequencing market report estimates the market size ($million 2023 to 2033) and key market segmented by NGS Platforms (Illumina – HiSeq Series, HiSeq X Ten & HiSeq X Five, MiSeq Series, NextSeq 500, Thermo Fisher – SOLiD Series, Ion PGM, Ion Proton, Ion S5 & Ion S5 XL, Pacific Biosciences – PacBio RS II, Sequel System), NGS Data Analysis (ChIP Sequencing, De Novo Sequencing, Exome Sequencing, Methyl Sequencing, RNA Sequencing, Targeted Resequencing, Whole Genome Sequencing), Technology (Ion Semiconductor Sequencing, Pyrosequencing, Sequencing by Ligation, Sequencing by Synthesis, Single-Molecule Real-time Sequencing), Applications (Agriculture and Animal Research, Biomarker Discovery, Diagnostics, Drug Discovery, Personalized Medicine), and End Users (Academic and Research Institutes, Hospitals & Clinics, Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Companies), and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).

The global next-generation sequencing market report also provides the detailed market landscape (market drivers, restraints, opportunities), market attractiveness analysis and profiles of major competitors in the global market including company overview, financial snapshot, key products, technologies and services offered, and recent developments. The global next-generation sequencing market research report is divided by geography (regional and country based) into North America (U.S., Canada), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Rest of LA), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Rest of EU), Asia Pacific (Japan, China, India, Rest of APAC), and Rest of the World.
