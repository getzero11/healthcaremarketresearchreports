## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), and the infection is found worldwide but most common in developing countries with limited access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene and health services. The commonly used tests for HEV infection include detection of IgM and IgG anti-HEV antibodies and detection of HEV RNA. Diagnosis of hepatitis E infection is usually based on the detection of specific IgM antibodies (ELISA). Additional tests include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the hepatitis E virus RNA in blood and/or stool samples, carried out in specialized laboratory facilities. Recently, a test for viral antigen detection in serum has been developed. Although several diagnostic assays for anti-HEV antibodies are available, they have undergone fairly limited testing and often provide discordant results, particularly for IgG antibodies. Improved validation of existing anti-HEV antibody assays or development of new assays with superior performance characteristics is urgently needed.

The global hepatitis E diagnostics market segmentation is based on test type (ELISA HEV IgM test kits, ELISA HEV IgG test kits, RT-PCR test kits, Others), end users (diagnostic laboratories, hospitals, point-of-care).
