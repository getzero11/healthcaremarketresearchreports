## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Osteoporosis disease is characterized by thinning and deterioration of bone tissue with loss of calcification and density, and it can progress over time. Women and older adults are more at risk for developing osteoporosis. Heredity, low body weight, and chronic use of certain medications (such as steroids) are also risk factors for the disease. Early diagnosis of osteoporosis is vital to maintaining good bone strength and avoid debilitating fractures at an old age.

Bone density scan is used to measure bone mineral density (BMD). It is most commonly performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA) or bone densitometry. Biochemical markers of bone turnover have been developed over the past 20 years that are more specific for bone tissue than conventional ones such as total alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline.

The development and introduction of new biochemical markers of bone metabolism in recent years led to a considerable increase in available laboratory methods. To evaluate the activity of osteoblastic synthesis, alkaline phosphatase and other bone-forming markers with higher tissue specificity such as bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and several collagen propeptides are used.

Bone degradation (calcium and hydroxyproline markers) can now be detected quickly and reliably with many new serological and urinary markers. Pyridinium derivatives and telopeptides as products of the metabolic activity of osteoclasts have been proved efficacious in diagnosis and therapy control.
