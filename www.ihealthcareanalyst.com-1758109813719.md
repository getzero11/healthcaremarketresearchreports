## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Pain management devices efficacious in relieving pain mainly include analgesic infusion pumps (intrathecal or external); electrical infusion pumps such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES/EMS), electrical stimulation devices (ESDs); neurostimulation devices such as spinal cord stimulation (SCS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and sacral nerve stimulation (SNS); and radiofrequency ablation devices. These devices are advantageous for long-term treatment of pain, especially for chronic conditions such as cancer and arthritis. Pain can be controlled with the use of electrical currents, analgesic pumps, radiofrequency ablation or minimally invasive procedures such as neurostimulation. Increasing number of patients with chronic medical conditions, globally rising geriatric population, favorable reimbursement policies, and commercialization of advanced therapeutic products are the major factors driving the growth of global pain management devices market.
