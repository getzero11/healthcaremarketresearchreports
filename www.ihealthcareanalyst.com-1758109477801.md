Immunotherapy enables the immune system to recognize and target cancer cells, making it a universal treatment to cancer. Immunotherapy has been an effective treatment for patients with certain types of cancer that have been resistant to chemotherapy and radiation treatment (e.g., melanoma).

These are exciting times for cancer immunotherapy. After many years of disappointing results, the tide has finally changed and immunotherapy has become a clinically validated treatment for many cancers. Immunotherapeutic strategies include cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, adoptive transfer of ex vivo activated T and natural killer cells, and administration of antibodies or recombinant proteins that either co-stimulate cells or block the so-called immune checkpoint pathways.

Cancer immunotherapy is focused on the immune system and may be more targeted than conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. The recent success of several immunotherapeutic regimes, such as monoclonal antibody blocking of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), has boosted the development of this treatment modality, with the consequence that new therapeutic targets and schemes which combine various immunological agents are now being described at a breathtaking pace.

Immunotherapy has gained worldwide acceptance for its generally lower side effects, ability to enhance benefits of chemotherapy and radiation and its ability to work when chemo and radiation don’t. Drug developers are taking big risks through R&D, acquisitions and partnerships in order to deliver patients the best treatments.

Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), a PD-1 inhibitor manufactured by Merck & Co., holds a strong lead among top immunotherapy drugs on the market. Keytruda treats melanoma, classic Hodgkin lymphoma, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, among other cancers. Among the PD-L1 inhibitors, Roche’s Tecentriq and AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi are nearly neck and neck in 2019 worldwide sales.

Of immunotherapies that use an adoptive cell transfer approach, CAR T-cell therapy brings together the body’s natural T cells with a modified version. So far, the FDA has approved two CAR T-cell therapies namely, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) and Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) for adults living with certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and for people under age 25 living with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has relapsed.
