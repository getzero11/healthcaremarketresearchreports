## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Computation has become essential to biological research. Genomic databases, protein data banks, MRI images of the human brain, and remote sensing data on landscapes contain unprecedented amounts of detailed information that are transforming almost all of biology. Computational biology or bioinformatics, is the science of using biological data to develop algorithms and relations among various biological systems. Computational biology is used in the development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological systems. The subareas of computational biology include comparative and functional genomics, systems biology, molecular and protein networks, population genomics and genetics, bioinformatics, model system genomics, agricultural genomics, and medical genomics.
