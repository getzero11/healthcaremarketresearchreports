## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The field of microfluidics uses microfabrication to create miniaturized devices to handle fluids. The field of microfluidics has four parents: molecular analysis, biodefence, molecular biology and microelectronics. Advances in microfluidics technology are revolutionizing molecular biology procedures for enzymatic analysis (glucose and lactate assays), DNA analysis (polymerase chain reaction and high-throughput sequencing), and proteomics. Microfluidics has numerous potential applications in health care, including drug discovery, formulation, and drug delivery, as well as life sciences research. An emerging application area for biochips is clinical pathology, especially the immediate point-of-care diagnosis of diseases. Much of the exploratory research in microfluidic

systems have been carried out in a polymer such as poly(dimethylsiloxane), or PDMS. Microfluidics can offer portable, cheap, single-use devices that replace centralized laboratory equipment in health care facilities and open new point-of-care diagnostic opportunities.

The global healthcare microfluidics market segmentation is based on product type (instruments, microfluidic chips, and cartridges and reagents), application (drug delivery, in vitro diagnostics, peripheral vascular diseases, pharmaceutical and biotech research, wound care management), material used (glass based, polymer based, silicon based), and end user (academics and research institutes, diagnostic labs, homecare, hospitals).
