## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Bone wax (BW) is used to mechanically control bleeding from bone surfaces during surgical procedures, by blocking the holes and causing immediate bone hemostasis through a tamponade effect. Bone wax is a mixture of beeswax, paraffin wax and isopropyl palmitate which is used to control injured bone surface bleeding. Bone wax is an effective hemostatic agent that generally is considered safe, cost-effective, and has found several other uses in dental /oral surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedic and thoracic surgeries.

Bone wax is commercially available in substantially non-absorbable formulations (Bone Wax, Sharpoint Lukens Bone Wax), as well as in absorbable/ resorbable formats (Hemasorb, Ostene). The FDA has recently approved a new water-soluble bone hemostasis material called Ostene (Baxter), which is designed to look and feel like bone wax.
