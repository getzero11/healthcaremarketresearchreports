Cervical dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is precancerous change in the lining cells of the cervix of the uterus. It is mainly caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), but it does not produce any signs or symptoms. Cervical dysplasia is diagnosed by tissue biopsy or Pap smears according to the degree of abnormality. Pap test results indicate a squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) or cellular tissue damage or dysplasia. HPV testing to detect a “high-risk” type is done if a Pap smear is abnormal.
