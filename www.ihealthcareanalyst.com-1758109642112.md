## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors are devices that measure the intracranial pressure. Elevated ICP is seen in head trauma, hydrocephalus, intracranial tumors, hepatic encephalopathy, and cerebral edema. Intractable elevated ICP can lead to death or devastating neurological damage either by reducing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and causing cerebral ischemia or by compressing and causing herniation of the brainstem or other vital structures. Major growth drivers include rising prevalence of neurological disorders and traumatic injuries and burgeoning demand for technologically advanced intracranial pressure monitors.

The global intracranial pressure monitors market report provides market size estimates ($million 2023 to 2033) for key market segmented by product \[external ventricular drain, lumbar drainage system, microtransducer ICP monitoring devices (fiber optic devices, pnematic transducers, strain gauge transducers), non-invasive ICP monitoring devices\], by application (intracerebral hemorrhage, meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, etc.)l by end user (hospitals, trauma centers), and forecast (CAGR%, 2025 to 2033).
