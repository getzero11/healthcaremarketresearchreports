Development in spinal cord stimulation (SCS) applications and technologies are fast advancing, allowing more effective and individualized treatment for patients, and may have the potential to salvage patients with previously failed neuromodulation.

Spinal cord stimulation is an intervention that has become increasingly popular due to the growing body of literature showing its effectiveness in treating pain and the reversible nature of the treatment with implant removal. It is currently approved by the FDA for chronic pain of the trunk and limbs, intractable low back pain, leg pain, and pain from failed back surgery syndrome.

In Europe, it has additional approval for refractory angina pectoris and peripheral limb ischemia. SCS devices are increasingly being used by anesthesiologists, orthopedic surgeons and physiatrists to address difficult-to-manage pain patients.

New SCS technologies are being used increasingly in the clinical environments and will undoubtedly expand the applicability of SCS. While there is already high-level proof for the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of traditional SCS therapies in treating chronic refractory low back pain with predominant limb pain, the more sophisticated next-generation SCS systems promise an even more targeted approach and wider applicability.

Traditional SCS therapy uses a small battery-powered pulse generator that transmits low-voltage electrical stimulation to spinal nerves to block the feeling of pain, substituting it with paresthesia, whereas in recent years, device-makers have introduced next-generation technologies with novel stimulation parameters including burst SCS, dorsal root ganglion SCS and high-frequency SCS that have shown compelling results in clinical trials.

These new therapies, which are much more targeted than traditional SCS systems and designed to achieve better outcomes, and reduce stimulation felt by patients. Newer devices are targeting axial low back pain and foot pain, areas that have been reported to be more difficult to treat with traditional spinal cord stimulation.

Percutaneous hybrid paddle leads, peripheral nerve field stimulation, nerve root stimulation, dorsal root ganglion, and high frequency stimulation are actively being refined to address axial low back pain and foot pain. Furthermore, several cost analysis studies have demonstrated that spinal cord stimulation is cost effective for these approved conditions.

The global spinal cord stimulation devices market segmentation is based on product/device type (rechargeable, non-rechargeable); application (degenerative disk disease, failed back syndrome, multiple back operations, unsuccessful disk surgery, complex regional pain syndrome, arachnoiditis or lumbar adhesive arachnoiditis); and end users (hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers).
