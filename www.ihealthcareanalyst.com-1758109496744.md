## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The bioactive dressing materials may have intrinsic wound healing activity or/and may serve as a support for the release of bioactive compounds such as antimicrobial agents (antibiotics, antiseptics, honey, plant extracts), growth factors, insulin. Many dressings now exploit ‘bioactive’ properties to promote healing and control infection which includes sustained release of antimicrobial compounds. e.g. Actisorb Silver 220 and Acticoat. The use of alginates (e.g. Kaltostat, Tegagen, SorbSan, SeaSorb, Algisite M, Algosteril, Acticoat Absorbent, AGA-100), hydrocolloids, and materials containing collagen or other extracellular matrix components (hyaluronic acid) for maintaining a moist wound environment is increasing, as these dressings are believed to interact with cells or matrix proteins in the wound bed to promote healing. Promogran is used in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Surgical grafting of split-thickness autologous skin using tissue-engineered ‘skin equivalents is the standard method for rapid closure of full-thickness burn wounds. Cell-free matrices are used to preserve the dermal architecture (e.g. Alloderm, Integra). Cell-containing matrices include both synthetic matrices, often made of polyglycolic acid mesh (e.g. Dermagraft), as well as natural biological substrates usually comprising collagen and glycosaminoglycans (e.g. Apligraf). Alternatively, non-cellular matrices, such as the hyaluronic acid scaffolds, (e.g. Hyalograft-3D, Laserskin – Hyaff-11) are recommended for culture with autologous patient cells prior to grafting.

The global bioactive wound dressings market segmentation is based on product types – antimicrobial dressings (chitosan-based, iodine-based, silver-based, chitin, honey), biological dressings (cell-based therapy, collagen dressings, keratin dressings, skin substitutes, growth factors, stem cell therapy), and moist dressings (alginate dressings, hydrocolloids dressings).
