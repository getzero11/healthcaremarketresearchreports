Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is defined as a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens with no evidence of clinically manifest active tuberculosis (TB) disease, including the absence of clinical signs or symptoms and a normal chest radiograph.

Preventing the progression of LTBI to active TB disease is an important public health goal that can substantially reduce TB transmission. According to recent World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, approximately one-quarter of the global population is infected with LTBI. The duration of latency is variable, and healthy individuals can harbor LTBI for a lifetime.

Diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection is one of the strategies recommended by the WHO to control and eliminate tuberculosis (TB) disease worldwide and is one of the elements of the WHO End TB Strategy.

With regard to acceptable methods of LTBI diagnosis, the WHO guidelines recommend that either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) should be used to detect LTBI.
