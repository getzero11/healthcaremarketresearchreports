## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Drug delivery method or process involves administering a pharmaceutical compound to achieve a therapeutic effect in humans or animals. Drug delivery technologies have enabled the development of many pharmaceutical products that improve patient health by enhancing the delivery of a therapeutic to its target site, minimizing off-target accumulation and facilitating patient compliance.

Innovation in delivery technologies and strategies has been catalyzed by the identification of unique delivery challenges associated with each class of therapeutic. As therapeutic modalities expanded beyond small molecules to include nucleic acids, peptides, proteins and antibodies, drug delivery technologies were adapted to address the challenges that emerged.

Drug delivery systems are categorized by the route of administration such as oral, injectable, ocular, pulmonary, topical, implantable, nasal or transmucosal drug delivery. For the treatment of human diseases, nasal and pulmonary routes of drug delivery are gaining increasing importance. These routes provide promising alternatives to parenteral drug delivery particularly for peptide and protein therapeutics.
