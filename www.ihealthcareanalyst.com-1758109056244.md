Minimally invasive bariatric surgeries are performed for patients with morbid obesity or obesity with secondary medical issues. Laparoscopic minimally invasive weight loss (bariatric) approaches offer the same potentially life-saving results as traditional open obesity surgery, but with significantly less pain and fewer complications, such as wound infections and hernias.

Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Band (LAGB) is the most common procedure done in Europe, where a silastic band placed around the proximal stomach percutaneously allowing for tightening or loosening via a subcutaneous port. Adjustable gastric band surgery is an example of bariatric surgery designed for obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or greater—or between 35 and 40 in cases of patients with certain comorbidities that are known to improve with weight loss, such as sleep apnea, diabetes, osteoarthritis, GERD, hypertension (high blood pressure), or metabolic syndrome, among others. Lap-Band System obtained U.S. FDA approval in 2001. The latest models include Lap-Band AP-L and Lap-Band AP-S. The Realize Adjustable Gastric Band obtained FDA approval in 2007. Gastric banding is reversible and is the safest of the bariatric procedures, however complications can occur that necessitate revision or removal of the device, or replacement of the port. Two other adjustable gastric bands are in use outside of the United States: Heliogast and Midband. Neither band has been approved by the FDA.

Intragastric Balloon System is a weight-loss system that uses a gastric balloon that occupies space in the stomach. Gastric balloons are generally considered to be safe and effective in the short run, however, the initial side effects of the balloon are common and may consist of nausea, vomiting, reflux and stomach cramps. Currently there are three FDA approved balloons in the USA. These approved devices are placed via the esophagus using endoscopy. Gastric balloon devices have been approved in many countries, among them Australia, Canada, Mexico, India, and several European and South American countries. Two different balloon devices available in the United States and approved by the FDA include ReShape Integrated Dual Balloon System (ReShape Dual Balloon) and Orbera. Costs for the gastric balloon are surgeon-specific and vary by region. Average cost in the U.S. is $8,150, and generally less in other countries. Insurance coverage is usually not provided in the U.S.

Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) for gastroparesis has been in use for more than a decade with proven beneficial effect on symptoms, quality of life and nutritional status. In general, electrical stimulation of gut tissue can modulate the neuromuscular function of the organs involved and/or affect afferent neural activity emanating from the organs. Gastric neurostimulator is a programmable device that generates mild electrical pulses for gastric electrical stimulation to treat chronic, intractable nausea and vomiting due to gastroparesis. Currently the only GES device used in the U.S. is the Enterra Therapy System, which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a humanitarian device exemption. In the U.S., the avaerge cost of the Enterra Therapy system is $30,000. The cost of the device and hospitalization in the UK is between £15,000 and £16,000. In Canada the total cost for the device implanted is around Can$10,685.
