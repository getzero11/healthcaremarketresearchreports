## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory condition. It can affect many different parts of the body but most commonly affects the joints, causing pain and stiffness. The cause of RA is unknown. It is different from osteoarthritis (OA), which is the most common form of arthritis; OA occurs when the cartilage protecting the joints wears down over time.

Treatment plays a key role in controlling the inflammation of RA and in minimizing joint damage. Treatment usually involves a combination of medications and other non-drug therapies. In some cases, treatment may also involve surgery. Surgical procedures used in the treatment of RA include synovectomy, tenosynovectomy, tendon realignment, reconstructive surgery or arthroplasty, and arthrodesis.
