Surgical resection for colorectal hepatic metastases (CRHM) or colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) is the preferred treatment for suitable candidates, and the only potentially curative modality. As the gold standard treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), surgery indeed prolongs the overall survival (OS) of patients, with 5-year survival rates of up to 51%.

However, due to various limitations, the majority of patients with CRHM are not candidates for liver resection. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the role of thermal tumor ablation (TTA) as a component of combined resection-ablation strategies, staged hepatic resections, or as standalone adjunct treatment for patients with CRHM.

Thus, ablative approaches have expanded the group of patients with CRHM that may benefit from liver-directed treatment strategies. Among the other curative therapeutic modalities developed, ablation is gaining focus because of its easy accessibility, high reproducibility, and minimal invasiveness.

Different ablation technologies, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), laser, and cryoablation, use heat or freezing as a means to achieve cell damage and death of the target tumor. More recently, irreversible electroporation (IRE), a non-thermal technology, has been applied for liver tumor ablation, including selected colorectal liver metastases (CLM) that were not amenable to thermal ablation due to high risk for collateral damage.
