## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors are a group of checkpoint inhibitor anticancer drugs that block the activity of PD-1 and PDL1 immune checkpoint proteins present on the surface of cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are emerging as a front-line treatment for several types of cancer.

The PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors act to inhibit the association of the PD-L1 with its receptor, PD-1. The interaction of these cell surface proteins is involved in the suppression of the immune system and occurs following infection to limit the killing of bystander host cells and prevent autoimmune disease.

Till-date, seven global PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are on the market with approvals across 17 cancer indications, many of which are served by multiple agents: Keytruda, Opdivo, Tecentriq, Imfinzi, Bavencio, Libtayo, and Jemperli.
