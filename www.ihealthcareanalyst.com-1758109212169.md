## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Non- Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) encompasses a wide variety of disease subtypes that affect approximately 1.5 million people worldwide. NHL is one of the most common cancers in the United States, accounting for about 4% of all cancers.  Highest incidence rates found in Australia, Western and Northern Europe, and North America. The lowest rates are found in Asia and Eastern Europe.

NHL is categorized into slow- progressing or indolent NHL (iNHL), and fast-progressing or aggressive NHL (aNHL). B cell lymphomas (BCLs) account for the majority (>85%) of cases of NHL. Follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large BCL (DLBCL) are the most common indolent and aggressive subtypes, respectively.

Depending on the type and stage of the lymphoma, treatment options may include: chemotherapy, immunotherapy targeted therapy drugs radiation therapy, stem cell transplant and surgery. Chemotherapy is usually used to treat NHL. Radiation, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, is used less often.

Highly specific monoclonal antibodies directed at lymphoma cells are used for initial treatment and recurrence of some types of NHL, as are antibodies linked to a radioactive atom. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation and low-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation (called non-myeloablative) are options if NHL persists or recurs after standard treatment.
