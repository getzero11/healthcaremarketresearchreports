Minimally invasive surgical procedures are often used to treat the most common type of incontinence, stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Injectable therapy using bulking agents is composed of synthetic materials, bovine collagen, or autologous substances.

The injection of bulking agents to treat a dysfunctional urethra is a minimally invasive method of correcting intrinsic sphincteric deficiency that results in stress urinary incontinence but is being performed less frequently in current practice, due to their application has been limited by placement, durability, antigenicity, and other compatibility issues.

Minimally invasive suburethral slings, namely the retropubic suburethral sling or the tension-free vaginal tape (TVT), also known as retropubic sling has become the mainstay for surgical management of moderate to severe stress urinary incontinence.

The transobturator slings procedure using Transobturator tapes (TOT/TVT-O) was introduced in 2001 with the aim of decreasing the risk of complication associated with the retropubic passage of the trocar, especially bowel and bladder injury.

Neuromodulation has been reported to be effective for the treatment of stress and urgency urinary incontinence. It is a well-established treatment option for patients with non-neurogenic overactive bladder and urinary retention. The cure and improvement rates of pelvic floor neuromodulation in urinary incontinence have improved over time.

The global minimally invasive female urinary incontinence devices market segmentation is based on product (injectable urethral bulking agents, urethral sling systems, neuromodulation systems); by incontinence type (stress incontinence, urge incontinence, mixed incontinence); and by end user (ambulatory surgical centers, gynecology clinics, hospitals).
