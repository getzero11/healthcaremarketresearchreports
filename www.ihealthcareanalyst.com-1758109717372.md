## Report Specifications: Market Size, Market Share, Growth Trends, Forecast, Geography

Biosensors are composed a biological recognition unit and a transducer which converts a biological response into a measurable electrical signal. Biosensors are used in a wide array of applications in medical diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, food industry, biodefense, and industrial processes. Although, the largest application for biosensors is to be blood glucose monitors, their use in various other applications such as infectious disease monitoring, blood gas analyses, cholesterol testing, pregnancy testing and non-medical applications such as industrial biology, food toxicity detection and military services is growing rapidly. Biosensors are primarily used for cancer detection and personalized medicine due to its accurate detection of specific biological analyte and reliable imaging of cancer cells. Biosensor-based medical devices provide better precision and accuracy, shorter lead time, painless diagnosis coupled with user friendly devices and cost-effectiveness. Extensive research and development activities to develop new and innovative medical devices are also driving the growth of the global biosensors market.
